In addition to full essays on\\nalternative therapies, the encyclopedia features specific\\nAlternative treatmentsections for diseases and condi-\\ntions that may be helped by complementary therapies.\\nINCLUSION CRITERIA\\nA preliminary list of diseases, disorders, tests and treat-\\nments was compiled from a wide variety of sources,\\nincluding professional medical guides and textbooks as\\nwell as consumer guides and encyclopedias. The general\\nadvisory board, made up of public librarians, medical\\nlibrarians and consumer health experts, evaluated the top-\\nics and made suggestions for inclusion. The list was sorted\\nby category and sent to GEM2 medical advisors, certified\\nphysicians with various medical specialities, for review.\\nFinal selection of topics to include was made by the med-\\nical advisors in conjunction with the Gale Group editor.\\nABOUT THE CONTRIBUTORS\\nThe essays were compiled by experienced medical\\nwriters, including physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and\\nother health care professionals. GEM2 medical advisors\\nreviewed the completed essays to insure that they are\\nappropriate, up-to-date, and medically accurate.\\nHOW TO USE THIS BOOK\\nThe Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine 2 has been\\ndesigned with ready reference in mind.\\n• Straight alphabetical arrangement allows users to\\nlocate information quickly.\\n• Bold-faced terms function as print hyperlinks that\\npoint the reader to related entries in the encyclopedia.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 IX\\nINTRODUCTION'),\n",

A transmit-\\nter sends high frequency sound waves into the body,\\nwhere they bounce off the different tissues and organs to\\nproduce a distinctive pattern of echoes. A receiver\\n“hears” the returning echo pattern and forwards it to a\\ncomputer, which translates the data into an image on a\\ntelevision screen. Because ultrasound can distinguish\\nsubtle variations between soft, fluid-filled tissues, it is\\nparticularly useful in providing diagnostic images of the\\nabdomen. Ultrasound can also be used in treatment.\\nPurpose\\nThe potential medical applications of ultrasound\\nwere first recognized in the 1940s as an outgrowth of the\\nsonar technology developed to detect submarines during\\nWorld War II. The first useful medical images were pro-\\nduced in the early 1950s, and, by 1965, ultrasound quali-\\nty had improved to the point that it came into general\\nmedical use. Improvements in the technology, applica-\\ntion, and interpretation of ultrasound continue. Its low\\ncost, versatility, safety and speed have brought it into the\\ntop drawer of medical imaging techniques.\\nWhile pelvic ultrasound is widely known and com-\\nmonly used for fetal monitoring during pregnancy ,\\nultrasound is also routinely used for general abdominal\\nimaging. It has great advantage over x-ray imaging tech-\\nnologies in that it does not damage tissues with ionizing\\nradiation. Ultrasound is also generally far better than\\nplain x rays at distinguishing the subtle variations of soft\\ntissue structures, and can be used in any of several\\nmodes, depending on the need at hand.\\nAs an imaging tool, abdominal ultrasound generally\\nis warranted for patients afflicted with: chronic or acute\\nabdominal pain; abdominal trauma; an obvious or sus-\\npected abdominal mass; symptoms of liver disease, pan-\\ncreatic disease,gallstones , spleen disease, kidney dis-\\nease and urinary blockage; or symptoms of an abdominal\\naortic aneurysm. Specifically:\\n• Abdominal pain. Whether acute or chronic, pain can\\nsignal a serious problem—from organ malfunction or\\ninjury to the presence of malignant growths. Ultrasound\\nscanning can help doctors quickly sort through poten-\\ntial causes when presented with general or ambiguous\\nsymptoms. All of the major abdominal organs can be\\nstudied for signs of disease that appear as changes in\\nsize, shape and internal structure.\\n• Abdominal trauma. After a serious accident, such as a\\ncar crash or a fall, internal bleeding from injured\\nabdominal organs is often the most serious threat to\\nsurvival. Neither the injuries nor the bleeding are\\nimmediately apparent. Ultrasound is very useful as an\\ninitial scan when abdominal trauma is suspected, and it\\ncan be used to pinpoint the location, cause, and severity\\nof hemorrhaging. In the case of puncture wounds,f r o m\\na bullet for example, ultrasound can locate the foreign\\nobject and provide a preliminary survey of the damage.\\nThe easy portability and versatility of ultrasound tech-\\nnology has brought it into common emergency room\\nuse, and even into limited ambulance service.\\n• Abdominal mass.

In\\nparticular, potentially malignant solid tumors can be\\ndistinguished from benign fluid-filled cysts and\\nabscesses. Masses and malformations in any organ or\\npart of the abdomen can be found.\\n• Liver disease. The types and underlying causes of liver\\ndisease are numerous, though jaundice tends to be a\\ngeneral symptom. Ultrasound can differentiate between\\nmany of the types and causes of liver malfunction, and\\nis particularly good at identifying obstruction of the\\nbile ducts and cirrhosis , which is characterized by\\nabnormal fibrous growths and reduced blood flow.\\n• Pancreatic disease. Inflammation and malformation of\\nthe pancreas are readily identified by ultrasound, as are\\npancreatic stones (calculi), which can disrupt proper\\nfunctioning.\\n• Gallstones. Gallstones cause more hospital admissions\\nthan any other digestive malady. These calculi can\\ncause painful inflammation of the gallbladder and also\\nobstruct the bile ducts that carry digestive enzymes\\nfrom the gallbladder and liver to the intestines. Gall-\\nstones are readily identifiable with ultrasound.\\n• Spleen disease. The spleen is particularly prone to\\ninjury during abdominal trauma. It may also become\\npainfully inflamed when beset with infection or\\ncancer. These conditions also lend themselves well to\\nultrasonic inspection and diagnosis.\\n• Kidney disease. The kidneys are also prone to traumatic\\ninjury and are the organs most likely to form calculi,\\nwhich can block the flow of urine and cause blood poi-\\nsoning (uremia). A variety of diseases causing distinct\\nchanges in kidney morphology can also lead to com-\\nplete kidney failure. Ultrasound imaging has proven\\nextremely useful in diagnosing kidney disorders.\\n• Abdominal aortic aneurysm. This is a bulging weak\\nspot in the abdominal aorta, which supplies blood\\ndirectly from the heart to the entire lower body. These\\naneurysms are relatively common and increase in\\nprevalence with age. A burst aortic aneurysm is immi-\\nnently life-threatening. However, they can be readily\\nidentified and monitored with ultrasound before acute\\ncomplications result.\\nUltrasound technology can also be used for treat-\\nment purposes, most frequently as a visual aid during\\nsurgical procedures—such as guiding needle placement\\nto drain fluid from a cyst, or to extract tumor cells for\\nbiopsy. Increasingly, direct therapeutic applications for\\nultrasound are being developed.\\nThe direct therapeutic value of ultrasonic waves lies\\nin their mechanical nature. They are shock waves, just like\\naudible sound, and vibrate the materials through which\\nthey pass. These vibrations are mild, virtually unnotice-\\nable at the frequencies and intensities used for imaging.\\nProperly focused however, high-intensity ultrasound can\\nbe used to heat and physically agitate targeted tissues.\\nHigh-intensity ultrasound is used routinely to treat\\nsoft tissue injuries, such as strains, tears and associated\\nscarring. The heating and agitation are believed to pro-\\nmote rapid healing through increased circulation. Strong-\\nly focused, high-intensity, high-frequency ultrasound can\\nalso be used to physically destroy certain types of\\ntumors, as well as gallstones and other types of calculi.\\nDeveloping new treatment applications for ultrasound is\\nan active area of medical research.\\nPrecautions\\nProperly performed, ultrasound imaging is virtually\\nwithout risk or side effects. Some patients report feeling\\na slight tingling and/or warmth while being scanned, but\\nmost feel nothing at all. Ultrasound waves of appropriate\\nfrequency and intensity are not known to cause or aggra-\\nvate any medical condition, though any woman who\\nthinks she might be pregnant should raise the issue with\\nher doctor before undergoing an abdominal ultrasound.\\nThe value of ultrasound imaging as a medical tool,\\nhowever, depends greatly on the quality of the equipment\\nused and the skill of the medical personnel operating it.\\nImproperly performed and/or interpreted, ultrasound can\\nbe worse than useless if it indicates that a problem exists\\nwhere there is none, or fails to detect a significant condi-\\ntion. Basic ultrasound equipment is relatively inexpen-\\nsive to obtain, and any doctor with the equipment can\\nperform the procedure whether qualified or not. Patients\\nshould not hesitate to verify the credentials of techni-\\ncians and doctors performing ultrasounds, as well as the\\nquality of the equipment used and the benefits of the pro-\\nposed procedure.\\nIn cases where ultrasound is used as a treatment tool,\\npatients should educate themselves about the proposed\\nprocedure with the help of their doctors—as is appropri-\\nate before any surgical procedure. Also, any abdominal\\nultrasound procedure, diagnostic or therapeutic, may be\\nhampered by a patient’s body type or other factors, such\\nas the presence of excessive bowel gas (which is opaque\\nto ultrasound). In particular, very obese people are often\\nnot good candidates for abdominal ultrasound.\\nDescription\\nUltrasound includes all sound waves above the fre-\\nquency of human hearing—about 20 thousand hertz, or\\ncycles per second. Medical ultrasound generally uses fre-\\nquencies between one and 10 million hertz (1-10 MHz).\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 22\\nAbdominal ultrasound\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 2'),\n",

While not\\nnecessarily harmful, such organs can cause prob-\\nlems if they grow too large or become cancerous. In\\nany case, their presence points to an underlying\\nabnormality in the parent organ.\\nBenign—In medical usage, benign is the opposite of\\nmalignant. It describes an abnormal growth that is\\nstable, treatable and generally not life-threatening.\\nBiopsy—The surgical removal and analysis of a tis-\\nsue sample for diagnostic purposes. Usually, the\\nterm refers to the collection and analysis of tissue\\nfrom a suspected tumor to establish malignancy.\\nCalculus —Any type of hard concretion (stone) in\\nthe body, but usually found in the gallbladder, pan-\\ncreas and kidneys. They are formed by the accumu-\\nlation of excess mineral salts and other organic\\nmaterial such as blood or mucous. Calculi (pl.) can\\ncause problems by lodging in and obstructing the\\nproper flow of fluids, such as bile to the intestines or\\nurine to the bladder.\\nCirrhosis—A chronic liver disease characterized by\\nthe invasion of connective tissue and the degenera-\\ntion of proper functioning—jaundice is often an\\naccompanying symptom. Causes of cirrhosis include\\nalcoholism, metabolic diseases, syphilis and conges-\\ntive heart disease.\\nCommon bile duct —The branching passage\\nthrough which bile—a necessary digestive\\nenzyme—travels from the liver and gallbladder into\\nthe small intestine. Digestive enzymes from the\\npancreas also enter the intestines through the com-\\nmon bile duct.\\nComputed tomography scan (CT scan)—A special-\\nized type of x-ray imaging that uses highly focused\\nand relatively low energy radiation to produce\\ndetailed two-dimensional images of soft tissue\\nstructures, particularly the brain. CT scans are the\\nchief competitor to ultrasound and can yield higher\\nquality images not disrupted by bone or gas. They\\nare, however, more cumbersome, time consuming\\nand expensive to perform, and they use ionizing\\nelectromagnetic radiation.\\nDoppler—The Doppler effect refers to the apparent\\nchange in frequency of sound wave echoes returning\\nto a stationary source from a moving target. If the\\nobject is moving toward the source, the frequency\\nincreases; if the object is moving away, the frequen-\\ncy decreases. The size of this frequency shift can be\\nused to compute the object’s speed—be it a car on\\nthe road or blood in an artery. The Doppler effect\\nholds true for all types of radiation, not just sound.\\nFrequency—Sound, whether traveling through air\\nor the human body, produces vibrations—mole-\\ncules bouncing into each other—as the shock wave\\ntravels along. The frequency of a sound is the num-\\nber of vibrations per second. Within the audible\\nrange, frequency means pitch—the higher the fre-\\nquency, the higher a sound’s pitch.\\nIonizing radiation—Radiation that can damage liv-\\ning tissue by disrupting and destroying individual\\ncells at the molecular level. All types of nuclear\\nradiation—x rays, gamma rays and beta rays—are\\npotentially ionizing. Sound waves physically vibrate\\nthe material through which they pass, but do not\\nionize it.\\nJaundice—A condition that results in a yellow tint\\nto the skin, eyes and body fluids. Bile retention in\\nthe liver, gallbladder and pancreas is the immediate\\ncause, but the underlying cause could be as simple\\nas obstruction of the common bile duct by a gall-\\nstone or as serious as pancreatic cancer. Ultrasound\\ncan distinguish between these conditions.\\nMalignant—The term literally means growing worse\\nand resisting treatment. It is used as a synonym for\\ncancerous and connotes a harmful condition that\\ngenerally is life-threatening.\\nMorphology—Literally, the study of form.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 17}, page_content='Higher frequency ultrasound waves produce more\\ndetailed images, but are also more readily absorbed and\\nso cannot penetrate as deeply into the body. Abdominal\\nultrasound imaging is generally performed at frequencies\\nbetween 2-5 MHz.\\nAn ultrasound machine consists of two parts: the\\ntransducer and the analyzer. The transducer both produces\\nthe sound waves that penetrate the body and receives the\\nreflected echoes. Transducers are built around piezoelec-\\ntric ceramic chips. (Piezoelectric refers to electricity that\\nis produced when you put pressure on certain crystals\\nsuch as quartz). These ceramic chips react to electric puls-\\nes by producing sound waves ( they are transmitting\\nwaves) and react to sound waves by producing electric\\npulses (receiving). Bursts of high frequency electric puls-\\nes supplied to the transducer causes it to produce the\\nscanning sound waves. The transducer then receives the\\nreturning echoes, translates them back into electric pulses\\nand sends them to the analyzer—a computer that orga-\\nnizes the data into an image on a television screen.\\nBecause sound waves travel through all the body’s\\ntissues at nearly the same speed—about 3,400 miles per\\nhour—the microseconds it takes for each echo to be\\nreceived can be plotted on the screen as a distance into the\\nbody. The relative strength of each echo, a function of the\\nspecific tissue or organ boundary that produced it, can be\\nplotted as a point of varying brightness. In this way, the\\nechoes are translated into a picture. Tissues surrounded\\nby bone or filled with gas (the stomach, intestines and\\nbowel) cannot be imaged using ultrasound, because the\\nwaves are blocked or become randomly scattered.\\nFour different modes of ultrasound are used in med-\\nical imaging:\\n• A-mode. This is the simplest type of ultrasound in\\nwhich a single transducer scans a line through the body\\nwith the echoes plotted on screen as a function of\\ndepth. This method is used to measure distances within\\nthe body and the size of internal organs. Therapeutic\\nultrasound aimed at a specific tumor or calculus is also\\nA-mode, to allow for pinpoint accurate focus of the\\ndestructive wave energy.\\n• B-mode. In B-mode ultrasound, a linear array of trans-\\nducers simultaneously scans a plane through the body\\nthat can be viewed as a two-dimensional image on\\nscreen. Ultrasound probes containing more than 100\\ntransducers in sequence form the basis for these most\\ncommonly used scanners, which cost about $50,000.\\n• M-Mode. The M stands for motion. A rapid sequence\\nof B-mode scans whose images follow each other in\\nsequence on screen enables doctors to see and mea-\\nsure range of motion, as the organ boundaries that\\nproduce reflections move relative to the probe. M-\\nmode ultrasound has been put to particular use in\\nstudying heart motion.\\n• Doppler mode. Doppler ultrasonography includes the\\ncapability of accurately measuring velocities of moving\\nmaterial, such as blood in arteries and veins. The prin-\\nciple is the same as that used in radar guns that measure\\nthe speed of a car on the highway. Doppler capability is\\nmost often combined with B-mode scanning to produce\\nimages of blood vessels from which blood flow can be\\ndirectly measured. This technique is used extensively to\\ninvestigate valve defects, arteriosclerosis and hyper-\\ntension, particularly in the heart, but also in the abdom-\\ninal aorta and the portal vein of the liver. These\\nmachines cost about $250,000.\\nThe actual procedure for a patient undergoing an\\nabdominal ultrasound is relatively simple, regardless of\\nthe type of scan or its purpose. Fasting for at least eight\\nhours prior to the procedure ensures that the stomach is\\nempty and as small as possible, and that the intestines\\nand bowels are relatively inactive. Fasting also allows the\\ngall bladder to be seen, as it contracts after eating and\\nmay not be seen if the stomach is full. In some cases, a\\nfull bladder helps to push intestinal folds out of the way\\nso that the gas they contain does not disrupt the image.\\nThe patient’s abdomen is then greased with a special gel\\nthat allows the ultrasound probe to glide easily across the\\nskin while transmitting and receiving ultrasonic pulses.\\nThis procedure is conducted by a doctor with the\\nassistance of a technologist skilled in operating the\\nequipment. The probe is moved around the abdomen to\\nobtain different views of the target areas. The patient will\\nlikely be asked to change positions from side to side and\\nto hold their breath as necessary to obtain the desired\\nviews. Discomfort during the procedure is minimal.\\nThe many types and uses of ultrasound technology\\nmakes it difficult to generalize about the time and costs\\ninvolved. Relatively simple imaging—scanning a suspi-\\ncious abdominal mass or a suspected abdominal aortic\\naneurysm—will take about half an hour to perform and\\nwill cost a few hundred dollars or more, depending on\\nthe quality of the equipment, the operator and other fac-\\ntors. More involved techniques such as multiple M-mode\\nand Doppler-enhanced scans, or cases where the targets\\nnot well defined in advance, generally take more time\\nand are more expensive.\\nRegardless of the type of scan used and the potential\\ndifficulties encountered, ultrasound remains faster and\\nless expensive than computed tomography scans (CT),\\nits primary rival in abdominal imaging.

The\\nstomach and intestines begin development outside the\\nbaby’s abdomen and only later does the abdominal wall\\nenclose them. Occasionally, either the umbilical opening\\nis too large, or it develops improperly, allowing the bow-\\nels or stomach to remain outside or squeeze through the\\nabdominal wall.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThere are many causes for birth defects that still\\nremain unclear. Presently, the cause(s) of abdominal wall\\ndefects is unknown, and any symptoms the mother may\\nhave to indicate that the defects are present in the fetus\\nare nondescript.\\nDiagnosis\\nAt birth, the problem is obvious, because the base of\\nthe umbilical cord at the navel will bulge or, in worse\\ncases, contain viscera (internal organs). Before birth, an\\nultrasound examination may detect the problem.

In addition, D&X may offer a lower\\ncost and shorter procedure time.\\nPrecautions\\nWomen considering D&X should be aware of the\\nhighly controversial nature of this procedure. A contro-\\nversy common to all late-term abortions is whether the\\nfetus is viable, or able to survive outside of the woman’s\\nbody. A specific area of controversy with D&X is that\\nfetal death does not occur until after most of the fetal\\nbody has exited the uterus. Several states have taken\\nlegal action to limit or ban D&X and many physicians\\nwho perform abortions do not perform D&X. This may\\nrestrict the availability of this procedure to women seek-\\ning late-term abortion.\\nDescription\\nIntact D&X, or partial birth abortion first involves\\nadministration of medications to cause the cervix to\\ndilate, usually over the course of several days. Next, the\\nphysician rotates the fetus to a footling breech position.\\nThe body of the fetus is then drawn out of the uterus feet\\nfirst, until only the head remains inside the uterus. Then,\\nthe physician uses an instrument to puncture the base of\\nthe skull, which collapses the fetal head. Typically, the\\ncontents of the fetal head are then partially suctioned out,\\nwhich results in the death of the fetus, and reduces the\\nsizes of the fetal head enough to allow it to pass through\\nthe cervix. The dead and otherwise intact fetus is then\\nremoved from the woman’s body.\\nPreparation\\nMedical preparation for D&X involves an outpatient\\nvisit to administer medications, such as laminaria ,t o\\ncause the cervix to begin dilating.\\nIn addition, preparation may involve fulfilling local\\nlegal requirements, such as a mandatory waiting period,\\ncounseling, or an informed consent procedure reviewing\\nstages of fetal development,childbirth, alternative abor-\\ntion methods, and adoption.\\nKEY TERMS\\nCervix—The narrow outer end of the uterus that\\nseparates the uterus from the vaginal canal.\\nFootling breech —A position of the fetus while in\\nthe uterus where the feet of the fetus are nearest\\nthe cervix would be the first part of the fetus to exit\\nthe uterus, with the head of the fetus being the last\\npart to exit the uterus.\\nLaminaria —A medical product made from a cer-\\ntain type of seaweed that is physically placed near\\nthe cervix to cause it to dilate.\\nAftercare\\nD&X typically does not require an overnight hospi-\\ntal stay, so a follow up appointment may be scheduled to\\nmonitor the woman for any complications.\\nRisks\\nWith all abortion, the later in pregnancy an abortion\\nis performed, the more complicated the procedure and\\nthe greater the risk of injury to the woman. In addition to\\nassociated emotion reactions, D&X carries the risk of\\ninjury to the woman, including heavy bleeding, blood\\nclots, damage to the cervix or uterus, pelvic infection,\\nand anesthesia-related complications. There is also a risk\\nof incomplete abortion, meaning that the fetus is not\\ndead when removed from the woman’s body. Possible\\nlong-term risks include difficulty becoming pregnant or\\ncarrying a future pregnancy to term.\\nNormal results\\nThe expected outcome of D&X is the termination of\\na pregnancy with removal of a dead fetus from the\\nwoman’s body.\\nResources\\nPERIODICALS\\nEpner, Janet E., et al. “Late-term Abortion.”JAMA 280, no. 8\\n(26 August 1998): 724-729.\\nSprang, M.

Dugan, M.S.\\nAbortion, selective\\nDefinition\\nSelective abortion, also known as selective reduc-\\ntion, refers to choosing to abort a fetus, typically in a\\nmulti-fetal pregnancy, to decrease the health risks to the\\nmother in carrying and giving birth to more than one or\\ntwo babies, and also to decrease the risk of complications\\nto the remaining fetus(es). The term selective abortion\\nalso refers to choosing to abort a fetus for reasons such as\\nthe woman is carrying a fetus which likely will be born\\nwith some birth defect or impairment, or because the sex\\nof the fetus is not preferred by the individual.\\nPurpose\\nA woman may decide to abort for health reasons, for\\nexample, she is at higher risk for complications during preg-\\nnancy because of a disorder or disease such as diabetes.\\nHowever, selective reduction is recommended often in\\ncases of multi-fetal pregnancy, or the presence of more than\\none fetus, typically, at least three or more fetuses. In the\\ngeneral population, multi-fetal pregnancy happens in only\\nabout 1-2% of pregnant women. But multi-fetal pregnan-\\ncies occur far more often in women using fertility drugs.\\nPrecautions\\nBecause women or couples who use fertility drugs\\nhave made an extra effort to become pregnant, it is possi-\\nble that the individuals may be unwilling or uncomfort-\\nable with the decision to abort a fetus in cases of multi-\\nfetal pregnancy. Individuals engaging in fertility treat-\\nment should be made aware of the risk of multi-fetal\\npregnancy and consider the prospect of recommended\\nreduction before undergoing fertility treatment.\\nDescription\\nSelective reduction is usually performed between\\nnine and 12 weeks of pregnancy and is most successful\\nwhen performed in early pregnancy. It is a simple proce-\\ndure and can be performed on an outpatient basis. A nee-\\ndle is inserted into the woman’s stomach or vagina and\\npotassium chloride is injected into the fetus.\\nPreparation\\nIndividuals who have chosen selective reduction to\\nsafeguard the remaining fetuses should be counseled\\nprior to the procedure. Individuals should receive infor-\\nmation regarding the risks of a multi-fetal pregnancy to\\nboth the fetuses and the mother compared with the risks\\nafter the reduction.\\nIndividuals seeking an abortion for any reason\\nshould consider the ethical implications whether it be\\nbecause the fetus is not the preferred sex or because the\\nfetus would be born with a severe birth defect.\\nAftercare\\nCounseling should continue after the abortion\\nbecause it is a traumatic event. Individuals may feel\\nguilty about choosing one fetus over another. Mental\\nhealth professionals should be consulted throughout the\\nprocess.\\nRisks\\nAbout 75% of women who undergo selective reduc-\\ntion will go into premature labor . About 4-5% of\\nwomen undergoing selective reduction also miscarry one\\nor more of the remaining fetuses. The risks associated\\nwith multi-fetal pregnancy is considered higher.\\nNormal results\\nIn cases where a multi-fetal pregnancy, three or\\nmore fetuses, is reduced to two, the twin fetuses typically\\ndevelop as they would as if they were conceived as twins.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nKnobil, Ernst and Jimmy D.

Women\\nhave abortions because continuing the pregnancy would\\ncause them hardship, endanger their life or health, or\\nbecause prenatal testing has shown that the fetus will be\\nborn with severe abnormalities.\\nAbortions are safest when performed within the first\\nsix to 10 weeks after the last menstrual period. The cal-\\nculation of this date is referred to as the gestational age\\nand is used in determining the stage of pregnancy. For\\nexample, a woman who is two weeks late having her\\nperiod is said to be six weeks pregnant, because it is six\\nweeks since she last menstruated.\\nAbout 90% of women who have abortions do so\\nbefore 13 weeks and experience few complications.\\nAbortions performed between 13-24 weeks have a higher\\nKEY TERMS\\nMulti-fetal pregnancy —A pregnancy of two or\\nmore fetuses.\\nSelective reduction—Typically referred to in cases\\nof multifetal pregnancy, when one or more fetuses\\nare aborted to preserve the viability of the remain-\\ning fetuses and decrease health risks to the mother.\\nrate of complications. Abortions after 24 weeks are\\nextremely rare and are usually limited to situations where\\nthe life of the mother is in danger.\\nPrecautions\\nMost women are able to have abortions at clinics or\\noutpatient facilities if the procedure is performed early in\\npregnancy. Women who have stable diabetes, controlled\\nepilepsy, mild to moderate high blood pressure, or who\\nare HIV positive can often have abortions as outpatients\\nif precautions are taken. Women with heart disease, pre-\\nvious endocarditis, asthma, lupus erythematosus, uter-\\nine fibroid tumors, blood clotting disorders, poorly con-\\ntrolled epilepsy, or some psychological disorders usually\\nneed to be hospitalized in order to receive special moni-\\ntoring and medications during the procedure.\\nDescription\\nV ery early abortions\\nBetween five and seven weeks, a pregnancy can be\\nended by a procedure called menstrual extraction. This\\nprocedure is also sometimes called menstrual regulation,\\nmini-suction, or preemptive abortion. The contents of the\\nuterus are suctioned out through a thin (3-4 mm) plastic\\ntube that is inserted through the undilated cervix. Suction\\nis applied either by a bulb syringe or a small pump.\\nAnother method is called the “morning after” pill, or\\nemergency contraception . Basically, it involves taking\\nhigh doses of birth control pills within 24 to 48 hours of\\nhaving unprotected sex. The high doses of hormones\\ncauses the uterine lining to change so that it will not sup-\\nport a pregnancy. Thus, if the egg has been fertilized, it is\\nsimply expelled from the body.\\nThere are two types of emergency contraception.\\nOne type is identical to ordinary birth control pills, and\\nuses the hormones estrogen and progestin). This type is\\navailable with a prescription under the brand name Pre-\\nven. But women can even use their regular birth control\\npills for emergency contraception, after they check with\\ntheir doctor about the proper dose. About half of women\\nwho use birth control pills for emergency contraception\\nget nauseated and 20 percent vomit. This method cuts the\\nrisk of pregnancy 75 percent.\\nThe other type of morning-after pill contains only\\none hormone: progestin, and is available under the brand\\nname Plan B. It is more effective than the first type with\\na lower risk of nausea and vomiting. It reduces the risk\\nof pregnancy 89 percent.\\nWomen should check with their physicians regard-\\ning the proper dose of pills to take, as it depends on the\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 9\\nAbortion, therapeutic\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 9'),\n",

This results in an incomplete\\nabortion that means the pregnancy continues.\\nFirst trimester abortions\\nThe first trimester of pregnancy includes the first 13\\nweeks after the last menstrual period. In the United\\nStates, about 90% of abortions are performed during this\\nperiod. It is the safest time in which to have an abortion,\\nand the time in which women have the most choice of\\nhow the procedure is performed.\\nMEDICAL ABORTIONS. Medical abortions are brought\\nabout by taking medications that end the pregnancy. The\\nadvantages of a first trimester medical abortion are:\\n• The procedure is non-invasive; no surgical instruments\\nare used.\\n• Anesthesia is not required.\\n• Drugs are administered either orally or by injection.\\n• The procedure resembles a natural miscarriage.\\nDisadvantages of a medical abortion are:\\n• The effectiveness decreases after the seventh week.\\n• The procedure may require multiple visits to the doctor.\\n• Bleeding after the abortion lasts longer than after a sur-\\ngical abortion.\\n• The woman may see the contents of her womb as it is\\nexpelled.\\nTwo different medications can be used to bring about\\nan abortion. Methotrexate (Rheumatrex) works by stop-\\nping fetal cells from dividing which causes the fetus to die.\\nOn the first visit to the doctor, the woman receives\\nan injection of methotrexate. On the second visit, about\\na week later, she is given misoprostol (Cytotec), an\\noxygenated unsaturated cyclic fatty acid responsible for\\nvarious hormonal reactions such as muscle contraction\\n(prostaglandin), that stimulates contractions of the\\nuterus. Within two weeks, the woman will expel the\\ncontents of her uterus, ending the pregnancy. A follow-\\nup visit to the doctor is necessary to assure that the\\nabortion is complete.\\nWith this procedure, a woman will feel cramping\\nand may feel nauseated from the misoprostol. This\\ncombination of drugs is 90-96% effective in ending\\npregnancy.\\nMifepristone (RU-486), which goes by the brand\\nname Mifeprex, works by blocking the action of prog-\\nesterone, a hormone needed for pregnancy to continue,\\nthen stimulates uterine contractions thus ending the\\npregnancy. It can be taken a much as 49 days after the\\nfirst day of a woman’s last period. On the first visit to\\nthe doctor, a woman takes a mifepristone pill. Two days\\nlater she returns and, if the miscarriage has not\\noccurred, takes two misoprostol pills, which causes the\\nuterus to contract. Five percent of women won’t need to\\ntake misoprostol. After an observation period, she\\nreturns home.\\nWithin four days, 90% of women have expelled the\\ncontents of their uterus and completed the abortion.\\nWithin 14 days, 95-97% of women have completed the\\nabortion. A third follow-up visit to the doctor is neces-\\nsary to confirm through observation or ultrasound that\\nthe procedure is complete. In the event that it is not, a\\nsurgical abortion is performed. Studies show that 4.5 to 8\\npercent of women need surgery or a blood transfusion\\nafter taking mifepristone, and the pregnancy persists in\\nabout 1 percent of women. In this case, surgical abortion\\nis recommended because the fetus may be damanged.\\nSide effects include nausea, vaginal bleeding and heavy\\ncramping. The bleeding is typically heavier than a nor-\\nmal period and may last up to 16 days.\\nMifepristone is not recommended for women with\\nectopic pregnancy, an IUD, who have been taking long-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 210\\nAbortion, therapeutic\\nUterus\\nEmbryonic\\ntissue\\nVagina Vulsellum\\nCervix\\nSpeculum\\nExtraction tube\\nBetween 5 and 7 weeks, a pregnancy can be ended by a pro-\\ncedure called menstrual extraction.The contents of the\\nuterus are suctioned out through a thin extraction tube that\\nis inserted through the undilated cervix.(Illustration by Elec-\\ntronic Illustrators Group.)\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 10'),\n",

The procedure is also called\\ndilation and evacuation (D & E), suction dilation, vacu-\\num curettage, or suction curettage.\\nAdvantages of a vacuum aspiration abortion are:\\n• It is usually done as a one-day outpatient procedure.\\n• The procedure takes only 10-15 minutes.\\n• Bleeding after the abortion lasts five days or less.\\n• The woman does not see the products of her womb\\nbeing removed.\\nDisadvantages include:\\n• The procedure is invasive; surgical instruments are used.\\n• Infection may occur.\\nDuring a vacuum aspiration, the woman’s cervix is\\ngradually dilated by expanding rods inserted into the\\ncervical opening. Once dilated, a tube attached to a suc-\\ntion pump is inserted through the cervix and the con-\\ntents of the uterus are suctioned out. The procedure is\\n97-99% effective. The amount of discomfort a woman\\nfeels varies considerably. Local anesthesia is often\\ngiven to numb the cervix, but it does not mask uterine\\ncramping. After a few hours of rest, the woman may\\nreturn home.\\nSecond trimester abortions\\nAlthough it is better to have an abortion during the\\nfirst trimester, some second trimester abortions may be\\ninevitable. The results of genetic testing are often not\\navailable until 16 weeks. In addition, women, especially\\nteens, may not have recognized the pregnancy or come to\\nterms with it emotionally soon enough to have a first\\ntrimester abortion. Teens make up the largest group hav-\\ning second trimester abortions.\\nSome second trimester abortions are performed as a\\nD & E. The procedures are similar to those used in the\\nfirst trimester, but a larger suction tube must be used\\nbecause more material must be removed. This increases\\nthe amount of cervical dilation necessary and increases\\nthe risk of the procedure. Many physicians are reluctant\\nto perform a D & E this late in pregnancy, and for some\\nwomen is it not a medically safe option.\\nThe alternative to a D & E in the second trimester is\\nan abortion by induced labor. Induced labor may require\\nan overnight stay in a hospital.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 26}, page_content='Description\\nThere are two types of abscesses, septic and sterile.\\nMost abscesses are septic, which means that they are the\\nresult of an infection. Septic abscesses can occur any-\\nwhere in the body. Only a germ and the body’s immune\\nresponse are required. In response to the invading germ,\\nwhite blood cells gather at the infected site and begin\\nproducing chemicals called enzymes that attack the germ\\nby digesting it. These enzymes act like acid, killing the\\ngerms and breaking them down into small pieces that can\\nbe picked up by the circulation and eliminated from the\\nbody. Unfortunately, these chemicals also digest body\\ntissues. In most cases, the germ produces similar chemi-\\ncals. The result is a thick, yellow liquid—pus—contain-\\ning digested germs, digested tissue, white blood cells,\\nand enzymes.\\nAn abscess is the last stage of a tissue infection that\\nbegins with a process called inflammation. Initially, as\\nthe invading germ activates the body’s immune system,\\nseveral events occur:\\n• Blood flow to the area increases.\\n• The temperature of the area increases due to the\\nincreased blood supply.\\n• The area swells due to the accumulation of water, blood,\\nand other liquids.\\n• It turns red.\\n• It hurts, because of the irritation from the swelling and\\nthe chemical activity.\\nThese four signs—heat, swelling, redness, and pain—\\ncharacterize inflammation.\\nAs the process progresses, the tissue begins to turn\\nto liquid, and an abscess forms. It is the nature of an\\nabscess to spread as the chemical digestion liquefies\\nmore and more tissue. Furthermore, the spreading fol-\\nlows the path of least resistance—the tissues most easily\\ndigested. A good example is an abscess just beneath the\\nskin. It most easily continues along beneath the skin\\nrather than working its way through the skin where it\\ncould drain its toxic contents. The contents of the abscess\\nalso leak into the general circulation and produce symp-\\ntoms just like any other infection. These include chills,\\nfever, aching, and general discomfort.\\nSterile abscesses are sometimes a milder form of the\\nsame process caused not by germs but by non-living irri-\\ntants such as drugs. If an injected drug like penicillin is\\nnot absorbed, it stays where it was injected and may\\ncause enough irritation to generate a sterile abscess—\\nsterile because there is no infection involved. Sterile\\nabscesses are quite likely to turn into hard, solid lumps as\\nthey scar, rather than remaining pockets of pus.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nMany different agents cause abscesses. The most\\ncommon are the pus-forming (pyogenic) bacteria like\\nStaphylococcus aureus, which is nearly always the cause\\nof abscesses under the skin. Abscesses near the large\\nbowel, particularly around the anus, may be caused by\\nany of the numerous bacteria found within the large\\nbowel. Brain abscesses and liver abscesses can be caused\\nby any organism that can travel there through the circula-\\ntion. Bacteria, amoeba, and certain fungi can travel in\\nthis fashion. Abscesses in other parts of the body are\\ncaused by organisms that normally inhabit nearby struc-\\ntures or that infect them. Some common causes of specif-\\nic abscesses are:\\n• skin abscesses by normal skin flora\\n• dental and throat abscesses by mouth flora\\n• lung abscesses by normal airway flora,pneumonia\\ngerms, or tuberculosis\\n• abdominal and anal abscesses by normal bowel flora\\nSpecific types of abscesses\\nListed below are some of the more common and\\nimportant abscesses.\\n• Carbuncles and other boils. Skin oil glands (sebaceous\\nglands) on the back or the back of the neck are the ones\\nusually infected. The most common germ involved is\\nStaphylococcus aureus. Acne is a similar condition of\\nsebaceous glands on the face and back.\\n• Pilonidal abscess. Many people have as a birth defect a\\ntiny opening in the skin just above the anus. Fecal bac-\\nteria can enter this opening, causing an infection and\\nsubsequent abscess.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 13\\nAbcess\\nAn amoebic abscess caused by Entameoba histolytica.\\n(Phototake NYC.

If\\nthe patient’s symptoms and physical examination do not\\nhelp, a physician may have to resort to a battery of tests to\\nKEY TERMS\\nCellulitis—Inflammation of tissue due to infection.\\nEnzyme—Any of a number of protein chemicals\\nthat can change other chemicals.\\nFallopian tubes—Part of the internal female anato-\\nmy that carries eggs from the ovaries to the uterus.\\nFlora—Living inhabitants of a region or area.\\nPyogenic—Capable of generating pus.

Recent or chronic dis-\\nease in an organ suggests it may be the site of an abscess.\\nDysfunction of an organ or system—for instance, seizures\\nor altered bowel function—may provide the clue. Pain\\nand tenderness on physical examination are common\\nfindings. Sometimes a deep abscess will eat a small chan-\\nnel (sinus) to the surface and begin leaking pus. A sterile\\nabscess may cause only a painful lump deep in the but-\\ntock where a shot was given.\\nTreatment\\nSince skin is very resistant to the spread of infection,\\nit acts as a barrier, often keeping the toxic chemicals of\\nan abscess from escaping the body on their own. Thus,\\nthe pus must be drained from the abscess by a physician.\\nThe surgeon determines when the abscess is ready for\\ndrainage and opens a path to the outside, allowing the\\npus to escape. Ordinarily, the body handles the remaining\\ninfection, sometimes with the help of antibiotics or other\\ndrugs. The surgeon may leave a drain (a piece of cloth or\\nrubber) in the abscess cavity to prevent it from closing\\nbefore all the pus has drained out.\\nAlternative treatment\\nIf an abscess is directly beneath the skin, it will be\\nslowly working its way through the skin as it is more\\nrapidly working its way elsewhere. Since chemicals\\nwork faster at higher temperatures, applications of hot\\ncompresses to the skin over the abscess will hasten the\\ndigestion of the skin and eventually result in its breaking\\ndown, releasing the pus spontaneously. This treatment is\\nbest reserved for smaller abscesses in relatively less dan-\\ngerous areas of the body—limbs, trunk, back of the neck.\\nIt is also useful for all superficial abscesses in their very\\nearly stages. It will “ripen” them.\\nContrast hydrotherapy , alternating hot and cold\\ncompresses, can also help assist the body in resorption of\\nthe abscess. There are two homeopathic remedies that\\nwork to rebalance the body in relation to abscess forma-\\ntion,Silica and Hepar sulphuris . In cases of septic\\nabscesses, bentonite clay packs (bentonite clay and a\\nsmall amount of Hydrastis powder) can be used to draw\\nthe infection from the area.\\nPrognosis\\nOnce the abscess is properly drained, the prognosis\\nis excellent for the condition itself.

The pus is made up of both live and\\ndead organisms and destroyed tissue from the white\\nblood cells that were carried to the area to fight the infec-\\ntion. Abscesses are often found in the soft tissue under\\nthe skin, such as the armpit or the groin. However, they\\nmay develop in any organ, and are commonly found in\\nthe breast and gums. Abscesses are far more serious and\\ncall for more specific treatment if they are located in\\ndeep organs such as the lung, liver or brain.\\nBecause the lining of the abscess cavity tends to\\ninterfere with the amount of the drug that can penetrate\\nthe source of infection from the blood, the cavity itself\\nmay require draining.

Turkington\\nAbuse\\nDefinition\\nAbuse is defined as any thing that is harmful, injuri-\\nous, or offensive. Abuse also includes excessive and\\nwrongful misuse of anything. There are several major types\\nof abuse: physical and sexual abuse of a child or an adult,\\nsubstance abuse, elderly abuse, and emotional abuse.\\nDescription\\nPhysical abuse of a child is the infliction of injury by\\nan other person. The injuries can include punching, kick-\\ning, biting, burning, beating, or pulling the victim’s hair.\\nThe physical abuse inflicted on a child can result in\\nbruises, burns, poisoning , broken bones, and internal\\nhemorrhages. Physical assault against an adult primarily\\noccurs with women, usually in the form of domestic vio-\\nlence. It is estimated that approximately three million\\nchildren witness domestic violence every year.\\nSexual abuse of a child refers to sexual behavior\\nbetween an adult and child or between two children, one\\nof whom is dominant or significantly older. The sexual\\nbehaviors can include touching breasts, genitals, and but-\\ntocks; either dressed or undressed. The behavior can also\\ninclude exhibitionism, cunnilingus, fellatio, or penetra-\\ntion of the vagina or anus with sexual organs or objects.\\nPornographic photography is also used in sexual\\nabuse with children. Reported sex offenders are 97%\\nmale. Females are more often perpetrators in child-care\\nsettings, since children may confuse sexual abuse by a\\nfemale with normal hygiene care. Sexual abuse by step-\\nfathers is five times more common than with biological\\nfathers. Sexual abuse of daughters by stepfathers or\\nfathers is the most common form of incest.\\nSexual abuse can also take the form of rape. The\\nlegal definition of rape includes only slight penile pene-\\ntration in the victim’s outer vulva area. Complete erec-\\ntion and ejaculation are not necessary. Rape is the perpe-\\ntration of an act of sexual intercourse whether:\\n• will is overcome by force or fear (from threats or by use\\nof drugs).\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 216\\nAbuse\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 16'),\n",

The\\ncriteria include one or more of the following occurring\\nwithin a 12-month period:\\n• recurrent substance use resulting in failure to fulfill\\nobligations at home, work, or school.\\n• using substance in situations that are physically danger-\\nous (i.e., while driving).\\n• recurrent substance-related legal problems.\\n• continued usage despite recurrent social and interper-\\nsonal problems (i.e., arguments and fights with signifi-\\ncant other).\\nAbuse in the elderly is common and occurs mostly\\nas a result of caretaker burnout, due to the high level of\\ndependency frail, elderly patients usually require. Abuse\\ncan be manifested by physical signs, fear, and delaying\\nor not reporting the need for advanced medical care.\\nElderly patients may also exhibit financial abuse (money\\nor possessions taken away) and abandonment.\\nEmotional abuse generally continues even after phys-\\nical assaults have stopped. In most cases it is a personally\\ntailored form of verbal or gesture abuse expressed to illic-\\nit a provoked response.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nChildren who have been abused usually have a variety\\nof symptoms that encompass behavioral, emotional, and\\npsychosomatic problems. Children who have been physi-\\ncally abused tend to be more aggressive, angry, hostile,\\ndepressed, and have low self-esteem. Additionally, they\\nexhibit fear,anxiety, and nightmares. Severe psychological\\nproblems may result in suicidal behavior or posttraumatic\\nstressdisorder. Physically abused children may complain\\nof physical illness even in the absence of a cause. They\\nmay also suffer from eating disorders and encopresis. Chil-\\ndren who are sexually abused may exhibit abnormal sexual\\nbehavior in the form of aggressiveness and hyperarousal.\\nAdolescents may display promiscuity, sexual acting out,\\nand—in some situations—homosexual contact.\\nPhysical abuse directed towards adults can ultimately\\nlead to death. Approximately 50% of women murdered\\nin the United States were killed by a former or current\\nmale partner. Approximately one-third of emergency\\nroom consultations by women were prompted due to\\ndomestic violence. Female victims who are married also\\nhave a higher rate of internal injuries and unconscious-\\nKEY TERMS\\nEncopresis—Abnormalities relating to bowel move-\\nments that can occur as a result of stress or fear.\\nness than victims of stranger assault (mugging, robbery).\\nPhysical abuse or rape can also occur between married\\npersons and persons of the same gender. Perpetrators usu-\\nally sexually assault their victims to dominate, hurt, and\\ndebase them. It is common for physical and sexual vio-\\nlence to occur at the same time. A large percentage of sex-\\nually assaulted persons were also physically abused in the\\nform of punching, beating, or threatening the victim with\\na weapon such as a gun or knife. Usually males who are\\nhurt and humiliated tend to physical assault persons\\nwhom they are intimately involved with, such as spouses\\nand/or children. Males who assault a female tend to have\\nexperienced or witnessed violence during childhood.\\nThey also tend to abuse alcohol, to be sexually assaultive,\\nand are at increased risk for assaultive behavior directed\\nagainst children. Jealous males tend to monitor the\\nwomen’s movements and whereabouts and to isolate\\nother sources of protection and support. They interpret\\ntheir behavior as betrayal of trust and this causes resent-\\nment and explosive anger outbursts during periods of los-\\ning control. Males may also use aggression against\\nfemales in an effort to control and intimidate partners.\\nAbuse in the elderly usually occurs in the frail, elderly\\ncommunity. The caretaker is usually the perpetrator. Care-\\ntaker abuse can be suspected if there is evidence suggest-\\ning behavioral changes in the elderly person when the\\ncaretaker is present. Additionally, elderly abuse can be\\npossible if there are delays between injuries and treatment,\\ninconsistencies between injury and explanations, lack of\\nhygiene or clothing, and prescriptions no being filled.\\nDiagnosis\\nChildren who are victims of domestic violence are\\nfrequently injured attempting to protect their mother\\nfrom an abusive partner. Injuries are visible by inspection\\nor self-report. Physical abuse of an adult may be also be\\nevident by inspection with visible cuts and/or bruises or\\nself report.\\nSexual abuse of both a child and an adult can be\\ndiagnosed with a history from the victim. Victims can be\\nassessed for ejaculatory evidence from the perpetrator.\\nEjaculatory specimens can be retrieved from the mouth,\\nrectum, and clothing. Tests for sexually transmitted dis-\\neases may be performed.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 17\\nAbuse\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 17'),\n",

Check the\\ningredients listed on the container to see if aceta-\\nminophen is included in the product.\\nStudies have shown that acetaminophen relieves pain\\nand reduces fever about as well as aspirin. But differences\\nbetween these two common drugs exist. Acetaminophen\\nis less likely than aspirin to irritate the stomach. However,\\nunlike aspirin, acetaminophen does not reduce the red-\\nness, stiffness, or swelling that accompany arthritis.\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe usual dosage for adults and children age 12 and\\nover is 325-650 mg every 4- 6 hours as needed. No more\\nthan 4 grams (4000 mg) should be taken in 24 hours.\\nBecause the drug can potentially harm the liver, people\\nwho drink alcohol in large quantities should take consid-\\nerably less acetaminophen and possibly should avoid the\\ndrug completely.\\nFor children ages 6-11 years, the usual dose is 150-\\n300 mg, three to four times a day.

A ring of muscle called the lower esophageal\\nsphincter encircles the esophagus just above the entrance to\\nthe stomach. This sphincter muscle is normally contracted\\nto close the esophagus. When the sphincter is closed, the\\ncontents of the stomach cannot flow back into the esopha-\\ngus. Backward flow of stomach contents (reflux) can irri-\\ntate and inflame the esophagus, causing symptoms such as\\nheartburn. The act of swallowing causes a wave of\\nesophageal contraction called peristalsis. Peristalsis pushes\\nfood along the esophagus. Normally, peristalsis causes the\\nesophageal sphincter to relax and allow food into the stom-\\nach. In achalasia, which means “failure to relax,” the\\nesophageal sphincter remains contracted. Normal peristal-\\nsis is interrupted and food cannot enter the stomach.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nAchalasia is caused by degeneration of the nerve\\ncells that normally signal the brain to relax the\\nesophageal sphincter. The ultimate cause of this degener-\\nation is unknown. Autoimmune disease or hidden infec-\\ntion is suspected.\\nSymptoms\\nDysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, is the most com-\\nmon symptom of achalasia. The person with achalasia usu-\\nally has trouble swallowing both liquid and solid foods,\\noften feeling that food “gets stuck” on the way down. The\\nperson has chest pain that is often mistaken for angina\\npectoris (cardiac pain). Heartburn and difficulty belching\\nare common. Symptoms usually get steadily worse. Other\\nsymptoms may include nighttime cough or recurrent\\npneumoniacaused by food passing into the lower airways.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of achalasia begins with a careful medical\\nhistory. The history should focus on the timing of symp-\\ntoms and on eliminating other medical conditions that\\nmay cause similar symptoms. Tests used to diagnose\\nachalasia include:\\n• Esophageal manometry. In this test, a thin tube is\\npassed into the esophagus to measure the pressure\\nexerted by the esophageal sphincter.\\n• X ray of the esophagus. Barium may be swallowed to\\nact as a contrast agent. Barium reveals the outlines of\\nthe esophagus in greater detail and makes it easier to\\nsee its constriction at the sphincter.\\n• Endoscopy. In this test, a tube containing a lens and a\\nlight source is passed into the esophagus. Endoscopy is\\nused to look directly at the surface of the esophagus.\\nThis test can also detect tumors that cause symptoms\\nlike those of achalasia. Cancer of the esophagus occurs\\nas a complication of achalasia in 2-7% of patients.\\nTreatment\\nThe first-line treatment for achalasia is balloon dila-\\ntion. In this procedure, an inflatable membrane or bal-\\nloon is passed down the esophagus to the sphincter and\\ninflated to force the sphincter open. Dilation is effective\\nin about 70% of patients.\\nThree other treatments are used for achalasia when\\nballoon dilation is inappropriate or unacceptable.\\n• Botulinum toxin injection. Injected into the sphincter,\\nbotulinum toxin paralyzes the muscle and allows it to\\nrelax. Symptoms usually return within one to two years.\\n• Esophagomyotomy. This surgical procedure cuts the\\nsphincter muscle to allow the esophagus to open.\\nEsophagomyotomy is becoming more popular with the\\ndevelopment of techniques allowing very small abdom-\\ninal incisions.\\n• Drug therapy. Nifedipine, a calcium-channel blocker,\\nreduces muscle contraction. Taken daily, this drug pro-\\nvides relief for about two-thirds of patients for as long\\nas two years.\\nPrognosis\\nMost patients with achalasia can be treated effective-\\nly. Achalasia does not reduce life expectancy unless\\nesophageal carcinoma develops.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 220\\nAchalasia\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 20'),\n",

The disorder appears in approxi-\\nmately one in every 10,000 births. Achondroplasia is\\nusually diagnosed at birth, owing to the characteristic\\nappearance of the newborn.\\nNormal bone growth depends on the production of\\ncartilage (a fibrous connective tissue). Over time, calci-\\num is deposited within the cartilage, causing it to hard-\\nen and become bone. In achondroplasia, abnormalities\\nof this process prevent the bones (especially those in\\nthe limbs) from growing as long as they normally\\nshould, at the same time allowing the bones to become\\nabnormally thickened. The bones in the trunk of the\\nbody and the skull are mostly not affected, although the\\nopening from the skull through which the spinal cord\\npasses (foramen magnum) is often narrower than nor-\\nmal, and the opening (spinal canal) through which the\\nspinal cord runs in the back bones (vertebrae) becomes\\nincreasingly and abnormally small down the length of\\nthe spine.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAchondroplasia is caused by a genetic defect. It is a\\ndominant trait, meaning that anybody with the genetic\\ndefect will display all the symptoms of the disorder.

Although achondroplasia can be\\npassed on to subsequent offspring, the majority of cases\\noccur due to a new mutation (change) in a gene. Interest-\\ningly enough, the defect seen in achondroplasia is one of\\nonly a few defects known to increase in frequency with\\nincreasing age of the father (many genetic defects are\\nlinked to increased age of the mother).\\nPeople with achondroplasia have abnormally short\\narms and legs. Their trunk is usually of normal size, as is\\ntheir head. The appearance of short limbs and normal\\nhead size actually makes the head appear to be oversized.\\nThe bridge of the nose often has a scooped out appear-\\nance termed “saddle nose.” The lower back has an abnor-\\nmal curvature, or sway back. The face often displays an\\noverly prominent forehead, and a relative lack of devel-\\nopment of the face in the area of the upper jaw. Because\\nthe foramen magnum and spinal canal are abnormally\\nnarrowed, nerve damage may occur if the spinal cord or\\nnerves become compressed. The narrowed foramen mag-\\nnum may disrupt the normal flow of fluid between the\\nbrain and the spinal cord, resulting in the accumulation\\nof too much fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus). Children\\nwith achondroplasia have a very high risk of serious and\\nrepeated middle ear infections, which can result in hear-\\ning loss.

Like all\\nenzymes, it is needed to trigger specific chemical reac-\\ntions. Acid phosphatase testing is done to diagnose\\nwhether prostate cancer has spread to other parts of the\\nbody (metastasized), and to check the effectiveness of\\ntreatment. The test has been largely supplanted by the\\nprostate specific antigen test (PSA).\\nPurpose\\nThe male prostate gland has 100 times more acid\\nphosphatase than any other body tissue. When prostate\\ncancerspreads to other parts of the body, acid phos-\\nphatase levels rise, particularly if the cancer spreads to\\nthe bone. One-half to three-fourths of persons who have\\nmetastasized prostate cancer have high acid phosphatase\\nlevels. Levels fall after the tumor is removed or reduced\\nthrough treatment.\\nTissues other than prostate have small amounts of\\nacid phosphatase, including bone, liver, spleen, kidney,\\nand red blood cells and platelets. Damage to these tissues\\ncauses a moderate increase in acid phosphatase levels.\\nAcid phosphatase is very concentrated in semen.\\nRape investigations will often include testing for the\\npresence of acid phosphatase in vaginal fluid.\\nPrecautions\\nThis is not a screening test for prostate cancer. Acid\\nphosphatase levels rise only after prostate cancer has\\nmetastasized.\\nDescription\\nLaboratory testing measures the amount of acid\\nphosphatase in a person’s blood, and can determine from\\nwhat tissue the enzyme is coming. For example, it is\\nimportant to know if the increased acid phosphatase is\\nfrom the prostate or red blood cells. Acid phosphatase\\nfrom the prostate, called prostatic acid phosphatase\\n(PAP), is the most medically significant type of acid\\nphosphatase.\\nKEY TERMS\\nEnzyme—A substance needed to trigger specific\\nchemical reactions.\\nMetastasize —Spread to other parts of the body;\\nusually refers to cancer.\\nProstate gland—A gland of the male reproductive\\nsystem.\\nSubtle differences between prostatic acid phos-\\nphatase and acid phosphatases from other tissues cause\\nthem to react differently in the laboratory when mixed\\nwith certain chemicals. For example, adding the chemi-\\ncal tartrate to the test mixture inhibits the activity of pro-\\nstatic acid phosphatase but not red blood cell acid phos-\\nphatase. Laboratory test methods based on these differ-\\nences reveal how much of a person’s total acid phos-\\nphatase is derived from the prostate. Results are usually\\navailable the next day.\\nPreparation\\nThis test requires drawing about 5-10 mL of blood.\\nThe patient should not have a rectal exam or prostate\\nmassage for two to three days prior to the test.\\nAftercare\\nDiscomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture\\nsite, and the person may feel dizzy or faint. Applying\\npressure to the puncture site until the bleeding stops will\\nreduce bruising. Warm packs to the puncture site will\\nrelieve discomfort.\\nNormal results\\nNormal results vary based on the laboratory and the\\nmethod used.\\nAbnormal results\\nThe highest levels of acid phosphatase are found in\\nmetastasized prostate cancer. Diseases of the bone, such\\nas Paget’s disease or hyperparathyroidism; diseases of\\nblood cells, such as sickle cell disease or multiple\\nmyeloma; or lysosomal disorders, such as Gaucher’s dis-\\nease, will show moderately increased levels.\\nCertain medications can cause temporary increases\\nor decreases in acid phosphatase levels.

It occurs when the\\npores of the skin become clogged with oil, dead skin\\ncells, and bacteria.\\nDescription\\nAcne vulgaris, the medical term for common acne, is\\nthe most common skin disease. It affects nearly 17 million\\npeople in the United States. While acne can arise at any\\nage, it usually begins at puberty and worsens during ado-\\nlescence. Nearly 85% of people develop acne at some time\\nbetween the ages of 12-25 years. Up to 20% of women\\ndevelop mild acne. It is also found in some newborns.\\nThe sebaceous glands lie just beneath the skin’s sur-\\nface. They produce an oil called sebum, the skin’s natural\\nmoisturizer. These glands and the hair follicles within\\nwhich they are found are called sebaceous follicles.\\nThese follicles open onto the skin through pores. At\\npuberty, increased levels of androgens (male hormones)\\ncause the glands to produce too much sebum. When\\nexcess sebum combines with dead, sticky skin cells, a\\nhard plug, or comedo, forms that blocks the pore. Mild\\nnoninflammatory acne consists of the two types of come-\\ndones, whiteheads and blackheads.\\nModerate and severe inflammatory types of acne\\nresult after the plugged follicle is invaded by Propioni-\\nbacterium acnes , a bacteria that normally lives on the\\nskin. A pimple forms when the damaged follicle weakens\\nand bursts open, releasing sebum, bacteria, and skin and\\nwhite blood cells into the surrounding tissues. Inflamed\\npimples near the skin’s surface are called papules; when\\ndeeper, they are called pustules. The most severe type of\\nacne consists of cysts (closed sacs) and nodules (hard\\nswellings). Scarring occurs when new skin cells are laid\\ndown to replace damaged cells.\\nThe most common sites of acne are the face, chest,\\nshoulders, and back since these are the parts of the body\\nwhere the most sebaceous follicles are found.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe exact cause of acne is unknown. Several risk\\nfactors have been identified:\\n• Age. Due to the hormonal changes they experience,\\nteenagers are more likely to develop acne.\\n• Gender. Boys have more severe acne and develop it\\nmore often than girls.\\n• Disease. Hormonal disorders can complicate acne in\\ngirls.\\n• Heredity. Individuals with a family history of acne have\\ngreater susceptibility to the disease.\\n• Hormonal changes. Acne can flare up before menstrua-\\ntion, during pregnancy, and menopause.\\n• Diet. No foods cause acne, but certain foods may cause\\nflare-ups.\\n• Drugs. Acne can be a side effect of drugs including\\ntranquilizers, antidepressants, antibiotics, oral contra-\\nceptives, and anabolic steroids.\\n• Personal hygiene. Abrasive soaps, hard scrubbing, or\\npicking at pimples will make them worse.\\n• Cosmetics. Oil-based makeup and hair sprays worsen\\nacne.\\n• Environment. Exposure to oils and greases, polluted air,\\nand sweating in hot weather aggravate acne.\\n• Stress. Emotional stress may contribute to acne.\\nAcne is usually not conspicuous, although inflamed\\nlesions may cause pain, tenderness, itching, or swelling.\\nThe most troubling aspects of these lesions are the nega-\\ntive cosmetic effects and potential for scarring. Some\\npeople, especially teenagers, become emotionally upset\\nabout their condition, and have problems forming rela-\\ntionships or keeping jobs.\\nDiagnosis\\nAcne patients are often treated by family doctors.\\nComplicated cases are referred to a dermatologist, a skin\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 224\\nAcne\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 24'),\n",

The doctor takes a complete medical\\nhistory, including questions about skin care, diet, factors\\ncausing flare-ups, medication use, and prior treatment.\\nPhysical examinationincludes the face, upper neck,\\nchest, shoulders, back, and other affected areas. Under\\ngood lighting, the doctor determines what types and how\\nmany blemishes are present, whether they are inflamed,\\nwhether they are deep or superficial, and whether there is\\nscarring or skin discoloration.\\nIn teenagers, acne is often found on the forehead,\\nnose, and chin. As people get older, acne tends to appear\\ntowards the outer part of the face. Adult women may\\nhave acne on their chins and around their mouths. The\\nelderly may develop whiteheads and blackheads on the\\nupper cheeks and skin around the eyes.\\nLaboratory tests are not done unless the patient\\nappears to have a hormonal disorder or other medical\\nproblem. In this case, blood analyses or other tests may\\nbe ordered. Most insurance plans cover the costs of diag-\\nnosing and treating acne.\\nTreatment\\nAcne treatment consists of reducing sebum produc-\\ntion, removing dead skin cells, and killing bacteria with\\ntopical drugs and oral medications. Treatment choice\\ndepends upon whether the acne is mild, moderate, or\\nsevere.\\nDrugs\\nTOPICAL DRUGS. Treatment for mild noninflamma-\\ntory acne consists of reducing the formation of new\\ncomedones with topical tretinoin, benzoyl peroxide, ada-\\npalene, or salicylic acid. Tretinoin is especially effective\\nbecause it increases turnover (death and replacement) of\\nskin cells. When complicated by inflammation, topical\\nantibiotics may be added to the treatment regimen.\\nImprovement is usually seen in two to four weeks.\\nTopical medications are available as cream, gel,\\nlotion, or pad preparations of varying strengths. They\\ninclude antibiotics (agents that kill bacteria), such as ery-\\nthromycin, clindamycin (Cleocin-T), and meclocycline\\n(Meclan); comedolytics (agents that loosen hard plugs\\nand open pores) such as the vitamin A acid tretinoin\\n(Retin-A), salicylic acid, adapalene (Differin), resorci-\\nnol, and sulfur. Drugs that act as both comedolytics and\\nantibiotics, such as benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid\\n(Azelex), or benzoyl peroxide plus erythromycin (Benza-\\nmycin), are also used. These drugs may be used for\\nmonths to years to achieve disease control.\\nAfter washing with mild soap, the drugs are applied\\nalone or in combination, once or twice a day over the\\nentire affected area of skin. Possible side effects include\\nmild redness, peeling, irritation, dryness, and an increased\\nsensitivity to sunlight that requires use of a sunscreen.\\nORAL DRUGS. Oral antibiotics are taken daily for\\ntwo to four months. The drugs used include tetracycline,\\nerythromycin, minocycline (Minocin), doxycycline, clin-\\ndamycin (Cleocin), and trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole\\n(Bactrim, Septra). Possible side effects include allergic\\nreactions, stomach upset, vaginal yeast infections,dizzi-\\nness, and tooth discoloration.\\nThe goal of treating moderate acne is to decrease\\ninflammation and prevent new comedone formation.

The vestibular and cochlear\\nnerves lie next to one another. They also run along side\\nother cranial nerves. People possess two of each type of\\nvestibulocochlear nerve, one that extends from the left\\near and one that extends from the right ear.\\nThe vestibular nerve transmits information concern-\\ning balance from the inner ear to the brain and the cochlear\\nnerve transmits information about hearing. The vestibular\\nnerve, like many nerves, is surrounded by a cover called a\\nmyelin sheath. A tumor, called a schwannoma, can some-\\ntimes develop from the cells of the myelin sheath. A tumor\\nis an abnormal growth of tissue that results from the\\nuncontrolled growth of cells. Acoustic neuromas are often\\ncalled vestibular schwannomas because they are tumors\\nthat arise from the myelin sheath that surrounds the\\nvestibular nerve. Acoustic neuromas are considered\\nbenign (non-cancerous) tumors since they do not spread to\\nother parts of the body. They can occur anywhere along\\nthe vestibular nerve but are most likely to occur where the\\nvestibulocochlear nerve passes through the tiny bony canal\\nthat connects the brain and the inner ear.\\nAn acoustic neuroma can arise from the left vestibu-\\nlar nerve or the right vestibular nerve. A unilateral tumor\\nis a tumor arising from one nerve and a bilateral tumor\\narises from both vestibular nerves. Unilateral acoustic\\nneuromas usually occur spontaneously (by chance).

A person\\nwith NF2 has inherited a predisposition for developing\\nacoustic neuromas and other tumors of the nerve cells.\\nAcoustic neuromas usually grow slowly and can\\ntake years to develop. Some acoustic neuromas remain\\nso small that they do not cause any symptoms. As the\\nacoustic neuroma grows it can interfere with the func-\\ntioning of the vestibular nerve and can cause vertigo and\\nbalance difficulties. If the acoustic nerve grows large\\nenough to press against the cochlear nerve, then hearing\\nloss and a ringing (tinnitus) in the affected ear will usu-\\nally occur. If untreated and the acoustic neuroma contin-\\nues to grow it can press against other nerves in the region\\nand cause other symptoms. This tumor can be life threat-\\nening if it becomes large enough to press against and\\ninterfere with the functioning of the brain.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nAn acoustic neuroma is caused by a change or\\nabsence of both of the NF2 tumor suppressor genes in a\\nnerve cell. Every person possesses a pair of NF2 genes in\\nevery cell of their body including their nerve cells. One\\nNF2 gene is inherited from the egg cell of the mother and\\none NF2 gene is inherited from the sperm cell of the\\nfather. The NF2 gene is responsible for helping to pre-\\nvent the formation of tumors in the nerve cells. In partic-\\nular the NF2 gene helps to prevent acoustic neuromas.\\nOnly one unchanged and functioning NF2 gene is\\nnecessary to prevent the formation of an acoustic neuro-\\nma. If both NF2 genes become changed or missing in\\none of the myelin sheath cells of the vestibular nerve\\nthen an acoustic neuroma will usually develop. Most uni-\\nlateral acoustic neuromas result when the NF2 genes\\nbecome spontaneously changed or missing. Someone\\nwith a unilateral acoustic neuroma that has developed\\nspontaneously is not at increased risk for having children\\nwith an acoustic neuroma. Some unilateral acoustic neu-\\nromas result from the hereditary condition NF2. It is also\\npossible that some unilateral acoustic neuromas may be\\ncaused by changes in other genes responsible for pre-\\nventing the formation of tumors.\\nBilateral acoustic neuromas result when someone is\\naffected with the hereditary condition NF2. A person with\\nNF2 is typically born with one unchanged and one\\nchanged or missing NF2 gene in every cell of their body.\\nSometimes they inherit this change from their mother or\\nfather. Sometimes the change occurs spontaneously when\\nthe egg and sperm come together to form the first cell of\\nthe baby. The children of a person with NF2 have a 50%\\nchance of inheriting the changed or missing NF2 gene.\\nA person with NF2 will develop an acoustic neuro-\\nma if the remaining unchanged NF2 gene becomes spon-\\ntaneously changed or missing in one of the myelin sheath\\ncells of their vestibular nerve. People with NF2 often\\ndevelop acoustic neuromas at a younger age. The mean\\nage of onset of acoustic neuroma in NF2 is 31 years of\\nage versus 50 years of age for sporadic acoustic neuro-\\nmas. Not all people with NF2, however, develop acoustic\\nneuromas. People with NF2 are at increased risk for\\ndeveloping cataracts and tumors in other nerve cells.\\nMost people with a unilateral acoustic neuroma are\\nnot affected with NF2. Some people with NF2, however,\\nonly develop a tumor in one of the vestibulocochlear\\nnerves. Others may initially be diagnosed with a unilater-\\nal tumor but may develop a tumor in the other nerve a\\nnumber of years later. NF2 should be considered in some-\\none under the age of 40 who has a unilateral acoustic neu-\\nroma. Someone with a unilateral acoustic neuroma and\\nother family members diagnosed with NF2 probably is\\naffected with NF2. Someone with a unilateral acoustic\\nneuroma and other symptoms of NF2 such as cataracts\\nand other tumors may also be affected with NF2. On the\\nother hand, someone over the age of 50 with a unilateral\\nacoustic neuroma, no other tumors and no family history\\nof NF2 is very unlikely to be affected with NF2.\\nSymptoms\\nSmall acoustic neuromas usually only interfere with\\nthe functioning of the vestibulocochlear nerve. The most\\ncommon first symptom of an acoustic neuroma is hearing\\nloss, which is often accompanied by a ringing sound (tin-\\nnitis). People with acoustic neuromas sometimes report\\ndifficulties in using the phone and difficulties in perceiving\\nthe tone of a musical instrument or sound even when their\\nhearing appears to be otherwise normal. In most cases the\\nhearing loss is initially subtle and worsens gradually over\\ntime until deafness occurs in the affected ear. In approxi-\\nmately 10% of cases the hearing loss is sudden and severe.\\nAcoustic neuromas can also affect the functioning of\\nthe vestibular branch of the vestibulocochlear nerve and\\nvan cause vertigo and dysequilibrium. Twenty percent of\\nsmall tumors are associated with periodic vertigo, which\\nis characterized by dizziness or a whirling sensation.\\nLarger acoustic neuromas are less likely to cause vertigo\\nbut more likely to cause dysequilibrium. Dysequilibrium,\\nwhich is characterized by minor clumsiness and a gener-\\nal feeling of instability, occurs in nearly 50% of people\\nwith an acoustic neuroma.\\nAs the tumor grows larger it can press on the surround-\\ning cranial nerves.

The purpose of this\\nevaluation is to obtain a detailed family history and\\ncheck for signs of NF2. If NF2 is strongly suspected\\nthen DNA testing may be recommended. DNA testing\\ninvolves checking the blood cells obtained from a rou-\\ntine blood draw for the common gene changes associat-\\ned with NF2.\\nTreatment\\nThe three treatment options for acoustic neuroma\\nare surgery, radiation, and observation. The physician\\nand patient should discuss the pros and cons of the differ-\\nent options prior to making a decision about treatment.\\nThe patient’s, physical health, age, symptoms, tumor\\nsize, and tumor location should be considered.\\nMicrosurgery\\nThe surgical removal of the tumor or tumors is the\\nmost common treatment for acoustic neuroma. In most\\ncases the entire tumor is removed during the surgery. If\\nthe tumor is large and causing significant symptoms, yet\\nthere is a need to preserve hearing in that ear, then only\\npart of the tumor may be removed. During the procedure\\nthe tumor is removed under microscopic guidance and\\ngeneral anesthetic. Monitoring of the neighboring cranial\\nnerves is done during the procedure so that damage to\\nthese nerves can be prevented. If preservation of hearing\\nis a possibility, then monitoring of hearing will also take\\nplace during the surgery.\\nMost people stay in the hospital four to seven days\\nfollowing the surgery. Total recovery usually takes four\\nto six weeks. Most people experience fatigue and head\\ndiscomfort following the surgery. Problems with balance\\nand head and neck stiffness are also common. The mor-\\ntality rate of this type of surgery is less than 2% at most\\nmajor centers. Approximately 20% of patients experi-\\nence some degree of post-surgical complications. In most\\ncases these complications can be managed successfully\\nand do not result in long term medical problems. Surgery\\nbrings with it a risk of stroke, damage to the brain stem,\\ninfection, leakage of spinal fluid and damage to the cra-\\nnial nerves. Hearing loss and/or tinnitis often result from\\nthe surgery. A follow-up MRI is recommended one to\\nfive years following the surgery because of possible\\nregrowth of the tumor.\\nStereotactic Radiation therapy\\nDuring stereotactic radiation therapy , also called\\nradiosurgery or radiotherapy, many small beams of radia-\\ntion are aimed directly at the acoustic neuroma. The radi-\\nation is administered in a single large dose, under local\\nanesthetic and is performed on an outpatient basis. This\\nresults in a high dose of radiation to the tumor but little\\nradiation exposure to the surrounding area. This treat-\\nment approach is limited to small or medium tumors.\\nThe goal of the surgery is to cause tumor shrinkage or at\\nleast limit the growth of the tumor. The long term effica-\\ncy and risks of this treatment approach are not known.\\nPeriodic MRI monitoring throughout the life of the\\npatient is therefore recommended.\\nRadiation therapy can cause hearing loss which can\\nsometimes occurs even years later. Radiation therapy can\\nalso cause damage to neighboring cranial nerves, which\\ncan result in symptoms such as numbness, pain or paralysis\\nof the facial muscles. In many cases these symptoms are\\ntemporary. Radiation treatment can also induce the forma-\\ntion of other benign or malignant schwannomas. This type\\nof treatment may therefore be contraindicated in the treat-\\nment of acoustic neuromas in those with NF2 who are pre-\\ndisposed to developing schwannomas and other tumors.\\nObservation\\nAcoustic neuromas are usually slow growing and in\\nsome cases they will stop growing and even become\\nsmaller or disappear entirely. It may therefore be appro-\\npriate in some cases to hold off on treatment and to peri-\\nodically monitor the tumor through MRI evaluations.\\nLong-term observation may be appropriate for example\\nin an elderly person with a small acoustic neuroma and\\nfew symptoms. Periodic observation may also be indicat-\\ned for someone with a small and asymptomatic acoustic\\nneuroma that was detected through an evaluation for\\nanother medical problem. Observation may also be sug-\\ngested for someone with an acoustic neuroma in the only\\nhearing ear or in the ear that has better hearing. The dan-\\nger of an observational approach is that as the tumor\\ngrows larger it can become more difficult to treat.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for someone with a unilateral acoustic\\nneuroma is usually quite good provided the tumor is diag-\\nnosed early and appropriate treatment is instituted. Long\\nterm hearing loss and tinnitis in the affected ear are com-\\nmon, even if appropriate treatment is provided. Regrowth of\\nthe tumor is also a possibility following surgery or radiation\\ntherapy and repeat treatment may be necessary. The progno-\\nsis can be poorer for those with NF2 who have an increased\\nrisk of bilateral acoustic neuromas and other tumors.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 230\\nAcoustic neuroma\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 30'),\n",

This chemical released from the pituitary gland\\nis called growth hormone (GH). The body’s ability to\\nKEY TERMS\\nSympathetic nerve —A nerve of the autonomic\\nnervous system that regulates involuntary and\\nautomatic reactions, especially to stress.\\nprocess and use nutrients like fats and sugars is also\\naltered. In children whose bony growth plates have not\\nclosed, the chemical changes of acromegaly result in\\nexceptional growth of long bones. This variant is called\\ngigantism, with the additional bone growth causing\\nunusual height. When the abnormality occurs after bone\\ngrowth stops, the disorder is called acromegaly.\\nDescription\\nAcromegaly is a relatively rare disorder, occurring in\\napproximately 50 out of every one million people (50/\\n1,000,000). Both men and women are affected. Because\\nthe symptoms of acromegaly occur so gradually, diagno-\\nsis is often delayed. The majority of patients are not\\nidentified until they are middle aged.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe pituitary is a small gland located at the base of\\nthe brain. A gland is a collection of cells that releases\\ncertain chemicals, or hormones, which are important to\\nthe functioning of other organs or body systems. The\\npituitary hormones travel throughout the body and are\\ninvolved in a large number of activities, including the\\nregulation of growth and reproductive functions. The\\ncause of acromegaly can be traced to the pituitary’s pro-\\nduction of GH.\\nUnder normal conditions, the pituitary receives input\\nfrom another brain structure, the hypothalamus, located\\nat the base of the brain. This input from the hypothala-\\nmus regulates the pituitary’s release of hormones. For\\nexample, the hypothalamus produces growth hormone-\\nreleasing hormone (GHRH), which directs the pituitary\\nto release GH. Input from the hypothalamus should also\\ndirect the pituitary to stop releasing hormones.\\nIn acromegaly, the pituitary continues to release GH\\nand ignores signals from the hypothalamus. In the liver,\\nGH causes production of a hormone called insulin-like\\ngrowth factor 1 (IGF-1), which is responsible for growth\\nthroughout the body. When the pituitary refuses to stop\\nproducing GH, the levels of IGF-1 also reach abnormal\\npeaks. Bones, soft tissue, and organs throughout the body\\nbegin to enlarge, and the body changes its ability to\\nprocess and use nutrients like sugars and fats.\\nIn acromegaly, an individual’s hands and feet begin\\nto grow, becoming thick and doughy. The jaw line, nose,\\nand forehead also grow, and facial features are described\\nas “coarsening”. The tongue grows larger, and because\\nthe jaw is larger, the teeth become more widely spaced.\\nDue to swelling within the structures of the throat and\\nsinuses, the voice becomes deeper and sounds more hol-\\nlow, and patients may develop loud snoring. Various hor-\\nmonal changes cause symptoms such as:\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 232\\nAcromegaly and gigantism\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 32'),\n",

This increase in skin tags\\nis also associated with the development of growths,\\ncalled polyps, within the large intestine that may eventu-\\nally become cancerous. Patients with acromegaly often\\nsuffer from headaches and arthritis. The various\\nswellings and enlargements throughout the body may\\npress on nerves, causing sensations of local tingling or\\nburning, and sometimes result in muscle weakness.\\nThe most common cause of this disorder (in 90% of\\npatients) is the development of a noncancerous tumor with-\\nin the pituitary, called a pituitary adenoma. These tumors\\nare the source of the abnormal release of GH. As these\\ntumors grow, they may press on nearby structures within the\\nbrain, causing headaches and changes in vision. As the ade-\\nnoma grows, it may disrupt other pituitary tissue, interfering\\nwith the release of other hormones. These disruptions may\\nbe responsible for changes in the menstrual cycle of\\nwomen, decreases in the sexual drive in men and women,\\nand the abnormal production of breast milk in women. In\\nrare cases, acromegaly is caused by the abnormal produc-\\ntion of GHRH, which leads to the increased production of\\nGH. Certain tumors in the pancreas, lungs, adrenal glands,\\nthyroid, and intestine produce GHRH, which in turn triggers\\nproduction of an abnormal quantity of GH.\\nDiagnosis\\nBecause acromegaly produces slow changes over\\ntime, diagnosis is often significantly delayed. In fact, the\\ncharacteristic coarsening of the facial features is often\\nnot recognized by family members, friends, or long-time\\nfamily physicians. Often, the diagnosis is suspected by a\\nnew physician who sees the patient for the first time and\\nis struck by the patient’s characteristic facial appearance.\\nComparing old photographs from a number of different\\ntime periods will often increase suspicion of the disease.\\nBecause the quantity of GH produced varies widely\\nunder normal conditions, demonstrating high levels of\\nGH in the blood is not sufficient to merit a diagnosis of\\nacromegaly. Instead, laboratory tests measuring an\\nincrease of IGF-1 (3-10 times above the normal level) are\\nuseful. These results, however, must be carefully inter-\\npreted because normal laboratory values for IGF-1 vary\\nwhen the patient is pregnant, undergoing puberty, elder-\\nly, or severely malnourished. Normal patients will show a\\ndecrease in GH production when given a large dose of\\nsugar (glucose). Patients with acromegaly will not show\\nthis decrease, and will often show an increase in GH pro-\\nduction. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is useful\\nfor viewing the pituitary, and for identifying and locating\\nan adenoma. When no adenoma can be located, the search\\nfor a GHRH-producing tumor in another location begins.\\nTreatment\\nThe first step in treatment of acromegaly is removal of\\nall or part of the pituitary adenoma.

Chi-\\nnese medicine has developed acupuncture, acupressure,\\nherbal remedies, diet,exercise , lifestyle changes, and\\nother remedies as part of its healing methods. Nearly all\\nof the forms of Oriental medicine that are used in the\\nWest today, including acupuncture, acupressure,shiatsu,\\nand Chinese herbal medicine, have their roots in Chinese\\nmedicine. One legend has it that acupuncture and acu-\\npressure evolved as early Chinese healers studied the\\npuncture wounds of Chinese warriors, noting that certain\\npoints on the body created interesting results when stim-\\nulated. The oldest known text specifically on acupunc-\\nture points, the Systematic Classic of Acupuncture, dates\\nback to 282 A.D. Acupressure is the non-invasive form of\\nacupuncture, as Chinese physicians determined that\\nstimulating points on the body with massage and pres-\\nsure could be effective for treating certain problems.\\nOutside of Asian-American communities, Chinese\\nmedicine remained virtually unknown in the United\\nStates until the 1970s, when Richard Nixon became the\\nfirst U.S. president to visit China.

Chinese medicine does not make as sharp a\\ndestinction as Western medicine does between mind and\\nbody. The Chinese system believes that emotions and\\nmental states are every bit as influential on disease as\\npurely physical mechanisms, and considers factors like\\nwork, environment, and relationships as fundamental to a\\npatient’s health. Chinese medicine also uses very different\\nsymbols and ideas to discuss the body and health. While\\nWestern medicine typically describes health as mainly\\nphysical processes composed of chemical equations and\\nreactions, the Chinese use ideas like yin and yang, chi,\\nand the organ system to describe health and the body.\\nEverything in the universe has properties of yin and\\nyang. Yin is associated with cold, female, passive, down-\\nward, inward, dark, wet. Yang can be described as hot,\\nmale, active, upward, outward, light, dry, and so on.\\nNothing is either completely yin or yang.

Chinese medicine has developed intri-\\ncate systems of how organs are related to physical and\\nmental symptoms, and it has devised corresponding\\ntreatments using the meridian and pressure point net-\\nworks that are classified and numbered. The goal of acu-\\npressure, and acupuncture, is to stimulate and unblock\\nthe circulation of chi, by activating very specific points,\\ncalled pressure points or acupoints . Acupressure seeks\\nto stimulate the points on the chi meridians that pass\\nclose to the skin, as these are easiest to unblock and\\nmanipulate with finger pressure.\\nAcupressure can be used as part of a Chinese\\nphysician’s prescription, as a session of massage ther-\\napy, or as a self-treatment for common aches and ill-\\nnesses. A Chinese medicine practitioner examines a\\npatient very thoroughly, looking at physical, mental and\\nemotional activity, taking the pulse usually at the\\nwrists, examining the tongue and complexion, and\\nobserving the patient’s demeanor and attitude, to get a\\ncomplete diagnosis of which organs and meridian\\npoints are out of balance. When the imbalance is locat-\\ned, the physician will recommend specific pressure\\npoints for acupuncture or acupressure. If acupressure is\\nrecommended, the patient might opt for a series of\\ntreatments from a massage therapist.\\nIn massage therapy, acupressurists will evaluate a\\npatient’s symptoms and overall health, but a massage\\ntherapist’s diagnostic training isn’t as extensive as a\\nChinese physician’s.

The therapist observes and guides the\\nenergy flow through the patient’s body throughout the\\nsession. Sometimes, special herbs (Artemesia vulgaris\\nor moxa) may be placed on a point to warm it, a process\\ncalled moxibustion. A session of acupressure is general-\\nly a very pleasant experience, and some people experi-\\nence great benefit immediately. For more chronic con-\\nditions, several sessions may be necessary to relieve\\nand improve conditions.\\nAcupressure massage usually costs from $30–70 per\\nhour session. A visit to a Chinese medicine physician or\\nacupuncturist can be more expensive, comparable to a\\nvisit to an allopathic physician if the practitioner is an\\nMD. Insurance reimbursement varies widely, and con-\\nsumers should be aware if their policies cover alternative\\ntreatment, acupuncture, or massage therapy.\\nSelf-treatment\\nAcupressure is easy to learn, and there are many\\ngood books that illustrate the position of acupoints and\\nmeridians on the body. It is also very versatile, as it can\\nbe done anywhere, and it’s a good form of treatment for\\nspouses and partners to give to each other and for parents\\nto perform on children for minor conditions.\\nWhile giving self-treatment or performing acupressure\\non another, a mental attitude of calmness and attention is\\nimportant, as one person’s energy can be used to help\\nanother’s. Loose, thin clothing is recommended. There are\\nthree general techniques for stimulating a pressure point.\\n• Tonifying is meant to strengthen weak chi, and is done\\nby pressing the thumb or finger into an acupoint with a\\nfirm, steady pressure, holding it for up to two minutes.\\n• Dispersing is meant to move stagnant or blocked chi,\\nand the finger or thumb is moved in a circular motion or\\nslightly in and out of the point for two minutes.\\n• Calming the chi in a pressure point utilizes the palm to\\ncover the point and gently stroke the area for about two\\nminutes.\\nThere are many pressure points that are easily found\\nand memorized to treat common ailments from headaches\\nto colds.\\n• For headaches, toothaches, sinus problems, and pain in\\nthe upper body, the “LI4” point is recommended.

A physician should\\nalways be consulted when there are doubts about medical\\nconditions. If a condition is chronic, a professional should\\nbe consulted; purely symptomatic treatment can exacer-\\nbate chronic conditions. Acupressure should not be\\napplied to open wounds, or where there is swelling and\\ninflammation. Areas of scar tissue, blisters,boils, rashes,\\nor varicose veins should be avoided. Finally, certain acu-\\npressure points should not be stimulated on people with\\nhigh or low blood pressure and on pregnant women.\\nResearch and general acceptance\\nIn general, Chinese medicine has been slow to gain\\nacceptance in the West, mainly because it rests on ideas\\nvery foreign to the scientific model. For instance, West-\\nern scientists have trouble with the idea of chi, the invisi-\\nble energy of the body, and the idea that pressing on cer-\\ntain points can alleviate certain conditions seems some-\\ntimes too simple for scientists to believe.\\nWestern scientists, in trying to account for the action\\nof acupressure, have theorized that chi is actually part of\\nthe neuroendocrine system of the body. Celebrated ortho-\\npedic surgeon Robert O. Becker, who was twice nominated\\nfor the Nobel Prize, wrote a book on the subject called\\nCross Currents: The Promise of Electromedicine; The Per-\\nils of Electropollution. By using precise electrical measur-\\ning devices, Becker and his colleagues showed that the\\nbody has a complex web of electromagnetic energy, and\\nthat traditional acupressure meridians and points contained\\namounts of energy that non-acupressure points did not.\\nThe mechanisms of acupuncture and acupressure\\nremain difficult to document in terms of the biochemical\\nprocesses involved; numerous testimonials are the prima-\\nry evidence backing up the effectiveness of acupressure\\nand acupuncture.

The American Medical Association has been\\nresistant to researching it, as it is based on concepts very\\ndifferent from the Western scientific model.\\nSeveral forms of acupuncture are being used today in\\nAmerica. Japanese acupuncture uses extremely thin nee-\\ndles and does not incorporate herbal medicine in its prac-\\ntice. Auricular acupuncture uses acupuncture points only\\non the ear, which are believed to stimulate and balance\\ninternal organs. In France, where acupuncture is very pop-\\nular and more accepted by the medical establishment, neu-\\nrologist Paul Nogier developed a system of acupuncture\\nbased on neuroendocrine theory rather than on traditional\\nChinese concepts, which is gaining some use in America.\\nBasic ideas of Chinese medicine\\nChinese medicine views the body as a small part of\\nthe universe, and subject to universal laws and principles\\nof harmony and balance. Chinese medicine does not\\ndraw a sharp line, as Western medicine does, between\\nmind and body. The Chinese system believes that emo-\\ntions and mental states are every bit as influential on dis-\\nease as purely physical mechanisms, and considers fac-\\ntors like work, environment, lifestyle and relationships as\\nfundamental to the overall picture of a patient’s health.\\nChinese medicine also uses very different symbols and\\nideas to discuss the body and health. While Western med-\\nicine typically describes health in terms of measurable\\nphysical processes made up of chemical reactions, the\\nChinese use ideas like yin and yang, chi, the organ sys-\\ntem, and the five elements to describe health and the\\nbody. To understand the ideas behind acupuncture, it is\\nworthwhile to introduce some of these basic terms.\\nYIN AND YANG. According to Chinese philosophy,\\nthe universe and the body can be described by two sepa-\\nrate but complementary principles, that of yin and yang.\\nFor example, in temperature, yin is cold and yang is hot.\\nIn gender, yin is female and yang is male. In activity, yin\\nis passive and yang is active. In light, yin is dark and\\nyang is bright; in direction yin is inward and downward\\nand yang is outward and up, and so on. Nothing is ever\\ncompletely yin or yang, but a combination of the two.\\nThese two principles are always interacting, opposing,\\nand influencing each other. The goal of Chinese medi-\\ncine is not to eliminate either yin or yang, but to allow\\nthe two to balance each other and exist harmoniously\\ntogether. For instance, if a person suffers from symptoms\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 41\\nAcupuncture\\nConception vessel\\nStomach meridian\\nLarge intestine meridian\\nGallbladder meridian\\nGovernor vessel\\nBladder meridian\\nTriple burner meridian\\nSmall intestine meridian\\nAcupuncture sites and meridians on the face and neck.(Illustration by Hans & Cassady.)\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 41'),\n",

Thus, acupuncture\\ntherapies seek to either increase or reduce yang, or\\nincrease or reduce yin in particular regions of the body.\\nCHI. Another fundamental concept of Chinese med-\\nicine is that of chi (pronounced chee, also spelled qi). Chi\\nis the fundamental life energy of the universe. It is invisi-\\nble and is found in the environment in the air, water, food\\nand sunlight. In the body, it is the invisible vital force\\nthat creates and animates life. We are all born with inher-\\nited amounts of chi, and we also get acquired chi from\\nthe food we eat and the air we breathe. The level and\\nquality of a person’s chi also depends on the state of\\nphysical, mental and emotional balance. Chi travels\\nthrough the body along channels called meridians.\\nTHE ORGAN SYSTEM. In the Chinese system, there\\nare twelve main organs: the lung, large intestine, stom-\\nach, spleen, heart, small intestine, urinary bladder, kid-\\nney, liver, gallbladder, pericardium, and the “triple\\nwarmer,” which represents the entire torso region. Each\\norgan has chi energy associated with it, and each organ\\ninteracts with particular emotions on the mental level. As\\nthere are twelve organs, there are twelve types of chi\\nwhich can move through the body, and these move\\nthrough twelve main channels or meridians. Chinese\\ndoctors connect symptoms to organs. That is, symptoms\\nare caused by yin/yang imbalances in one or more\\norgans, or by an unhealthy flow of chi to or from one\\nKEY TERMS\\nAcupressure —Form of massage using acupunc-\\nture points.\\nAuricular acupuncture —Acupuncture using only\\npoints found on the ears.\\nChi—Basic life energy.\\nMeridian —Channel through which chi travels in\\nthe body.\\nMoxibustion —Acupuncture technique which\\nburns the herb moxa or mugwort.\\nTonification—Acupuncture technique for strength-\\nening the body.\\nYin/Yang—Universal characteristics used to des-\\ncribe aspects of the natural world.\\norgan to another. Each organ has a different profile of\\nsymptoms it can manifest.\\nTHE FIVE ELEMENTS. Another basis of Chinese theo-\\nry is that the world and body are made up of five main\\nelements: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. These ele-\\nments are all interconnected, and each element either\\ngenerates or controls another element. For instance,\\nwater controls fire and earth generates metal. Each organ\\nis associated with one of the five elements. The Chinese\\nsystem uses elements and organs to describe and treat\\nconditions. For instance, the kidney is associated with\\nwater and the heart is associated with fire, and the two\\norgans are related as water and fire are related. If the kid-\\nney is weak, then there might be a corresponding fire\\nproblem in the heart, so treatment might be made by\\nacupuncture or herbs to cool the heart system and/or\\nincrease energy in the kidney system.\\nThe Chinese have developed an intricate system of\\nhow organs and elements are related to physical and\\nmental symptoms, and the above example is a very sim-\\nple one. Although this system sounds suspect to Western\\nscientists, some interesting parallels have been observed.\\nFor instance, Western medicine has observed that with\\nsevere heart problems, kidney failure often follows, but it\\nstill does not know exactly why. In Chinese medicine,\\nthis connection between the two organs has long been\\nestablished.\\nMEDICAL PROBLEMS AND ACUPUNCTURE. In Chi-\\nnese medicine, disease as seen as imbalances in the organ\\nsystem or chi meridians, and the goal of any remedy or\\ntreatment is to assist the body in reestablishing its innate\\nharmony. Disease can be caused by internal factors like\\nemotions, external factors like the environment and\\nweather, and other factors like injuries, trauma, diet, and\\ngerms. However, infection is seen not as primarily a\\nproblem with germs and viruses, but as a weakness in the\\nenergy of the body which is allowing a sickness to occur.\\nIn Chinese medicine, no two illnesses are ever the same,\\nas each body has its own characteristics of symptoms and\\nbalance. Acupuncture is used to open or adjust the flow\\nof chi throughout the organ system, which will strength-\\nen the body and prompt it to heal itself.\\nA VISIT TO THE ACUPUNCTURIST. The first thing an\\nacupuncturist will do is get a thorough idea of a patient’s\\nmedical history and symptoms, both physical and emo-\\ntional. This is done with a long questionnaire and inter-\\nview. Then the acupuncturist will examine the patient to\\nfind further symptoms, looking closely at the tongue, the\\npulse at various points in the body, the complexion, gen-\\neral behavior, and other signs like coughs or pains. From\\nthis, the practitioner will be able to determine patterns of\\nsymptoms which indicate which organs and areas are\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 242\\nAcupuncture\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 42'),\n",

Depending on the problem, the acupunctur-\\nist will insert needles to manipulate chi on one or more\\nof the twelve organ meridians. On these twelve meridi-\\nans, there are nearly 2,000 points which can be used in\\nacupuncture, with around 200 points being most fre-\\nquently used by traditional acupuncturists. During an\\nindividual treatment, one to twenty needles may be used,\\ndepending on which meridian points are chosen.\\nAcupuncture needles are always sterilized and\\nacupuncture is a very safe procedure. The depth of inser-\\ntion of needles varies, depending on which chi channels are\\nbeing treated. Some points barely go beyond superficial\\nlayers of skin, while some acupuncture points require a\\ndepth of 1-3 in (2.5-7.5 cm) of needle. The needles general-\\nly do not cause pain. Patients sometimes report pinching\\nsensations and often pleasant sensations, as the body expe-\\nriences healing. Depending on the problem, the acupunc-\\nturist might spin or move the needles, or even pass a slight\\nelectrical current through some of them. Moxibustion may\\nbe sometimes used, in which an herbal mixture (moxa or\\nmugwort) is either burned like incense on the acupuncture\\npoint or on the end of the needle, which is believed to stim-\\nulate chi in a particular way. Also, acupuncturists some-\\ntimes use cupping, during which small suction cups are\\nplaced on meridian points to stimulate them.\\nHow long the needles are inserted also varies. Some\\npatients only require a quick in and out insertion to clear\\nproblems and provide tonification (strengthening of\\nhealth), while some other conditions might require nee-\\ndles inserted up to an hour or more. The average visit to\\nan acupuncturist takes about thirty minutes. The number\\nof visits to the acupuncturist varies as well, with some\\nconditions improved in one or two sessions and others\\nrequiring a series of six or more visits over the course of\\nweeks or months.\\nCosts for acupuncture can vary, depending on whether\\nthe practitioner is an MD. Initial visits with non-MD\\nacupuncturists can run from $50-$100, with follow-up vis-\\nits usually costing less. Insurance reimbursement also\\nvaries widely, depending on the company and state. Regu-\\nlations have been changing often. Some states authorize\\nMedicaid to cover acupuncture for certain conditions, and\\nsome states have mandated that general coverage pay for\\nacupuncture. Consumers should be aware of the provisions\\nfor acupuncture in their individual policies.\\nPrecautions\\nAcupuncture is generally a very safe procedure. If a\\npatient is in doubt about a medical condition, more than\\none physician should be consulted. Also, a patient should\\nalways feel comfortable and confident that their\\nacupuncturist is knowledgable and properly trained.\\nResearch and general acceptance\\nMainstream medicine has been slow to accept acupunc-\\nture; although more MDs are using it, the American Medical\\nAssociation does not recognize it as a specialty. The reason\\nfor this is that the mechanism of acupuncture is difficult to\\nscientifically understand or measure, such as the invisible\\nenergy of chi in the body. Western medicine, admitting that\\nacupuncture works in many cases, has theorized that the\\nenergy meridians are actually part of the nervous system and\\nthat acupuncture relieves pain by releasing endorphins, or\\nnatural pain killers, into the bloodstream. Despite the ambi-\\nguity in the biochemistry involved, acupuncture continues to\\nshow effectiveness in clinical tests, from reducing pain to\\nalleviating the symptoms of chronic illnesses, and research\\nin acupuncture is currently growing. The Office of Alterna-\\ntive Medicine of the National Institute of Health is currently\\nfunding research in the use of acupuncture for treating\\ndepression and attention-deficit disorder.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nFleischman, Dr. Gary F.

Kidney (or renal) failure occurs when kidney func-\\ntioning becomes impaired. Fluids and toxins begin to\\naccumulate in the bloodstream. As fluids build up in the\\nbloodstream, the patient with acute kidney failure may\\nbecome puffy and swollen (edematous) in the face, hands,\\nand feet. Their blood pressure typically begins to rise, and\\nthey may experience fatigue and nausea.\\nUnlike chronic kidney failure , which is long term\\nand irreversible, acute kidney failure is a temporary con-\\ndition. With proper and timely treatment, it can typically\\nbe reversed. Often there is no permanent damage to the\\nkidneys. Acute kidney failure appears most frequently as\\na complication of serious illness, like heart failure,l i v e r\\nfailure, dehydration, severe burns, and excessive bleed-\\ning (hemorrhage). It may also be caused by an obstruc-\\ntion to the urinary tract or as a direct result of kidney dis-\\nease, injury, or an adverse reaction to a medicine.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAcute kidney failure can be caused by many differ-\\nent illnesses, injuries, and infections. These conditions\\nfall into three main categories:prerenal, postrenal, and\\nintrarenal conditions.\\nPrerenal conditions do not damage the kidney, but\\ncan cause diminished kidney function. They are the most\\ncommon cause of acute renal failure, and include:\\n• dehydration\\n• hemorrhage\\n• septicemia, or sepsis\\n• heart failure\\n• liver failure\\n• burns\\nPostrenal conditions cause kidney failure by obstruct-\\ning the urinary tract. These conditions include:\\n• inflammation of the prostate gland in men (prostatitis)\\n• enlargement of the prostate gland (benign prostatic\\nhypertrophy)\\n• bladder or pelvic tumors\\n• kidney stones (calculi)\\nIntrarenal conditions involve kidney disease or\\ndirect injury to the kidneys. These conditions include:\\n• lack of blood supply to the kidneys (ischemia)\\n• use of radiocontrast agents in patients with kidney\\nproblems\\n• drug abuse or overdose\\n• long-term use of nephrotoxic medications, like certain\\npain medicines\\n• acute inflammation of the glomeruli, or filters, of the\\nkidney (glomerulonephritis)\\n• kidney infections (pyelitis or pyelonephritis)\\nCommon symptoms of acute kidney failure include:\\n• anemia. The kidneys are responsible for producing ery-\\nthropoietin (EPO), a hormone that stimulates red blood\\ncell production. If kidney disease causes shrinking of\\nthe kidney, red blood cell production is reduced, lead-\\ning to anemia.\\n• bad breath or bad taste in mouth. Urea in the saliva may\\ncause an ammonia-like taste in the mouth.\\n• bone and joint problems. The kidneys produce vitamin\\nD, which helps the body absorb calcium and keeps\\nbones strong. For patients with kidney failure, bones\\nmay become brittle. In children, normal growth may be\\nstunted. Joint pain may also occur as a result of high\\nphosphate levels in the blood. Retention of uric acid\\nmay cause gout.\\n• edema. Puffiness or swelling in the arms, hands, feet,\\nand around the eyes.\\n• frequent urination.\\n• foamy or bloody urine. Protein in the urine may cause it\\nto foam significantly. Blood in the urine may indicate\\nbleeding from diseased or obstructed kidneys, bladder,\\nor ureters.\\n• headaches. High blood pressure may trigger headaches.\\n• hypertension, or high blood pressure. The retention of\\nfluids and wastes causes blood volume to increase. This\\nmakes blood pressure rise.\\n• increased fatigue. Toxic substances in the blood and the\\npresence of anemia may cause the patient to feel\\nexhausted.\\n• itching. Phosphorus, normally eliminated in the urine,\\naccumulates in the blood of patients with kidney failure.\\nAn increased phosphorus level may cause the skin to itch.\\n• lower back pain. Patients suffering from certain kidney\\nproblems (like kidney stones and other obstructions)\\nmay have pain where the kidneys are located, in the\\nsmall of the back below the ribs.\\n• nausea. Urea in the gastric juices may cause upset\\nstomach.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 244\\nAcute kidney failure\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 44'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 58}, page_content='Diagnosis\\nKidney failure is diagnosed by a doctor. A nephrolo-\\ngist, a doctor that specializes in the kidney, may be con-\\nsulted to confirm the diagnosis and recommend treat-\\nment options. The patient that is suspected of having\\nacute kidney failure will have blood and urine tests to\\ndetermine the level of kidney function. A blood test will\\nassess the levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen\\n(BUN), uric acid, phosphate, sodium, and potassium.\\nThe kidney regulates these agents in the blood. Urine\\nsamples will also be collected, usually over a 24-hour\\nperiod, to assess protein loss and/or creatinine clearance.\\nDetermining the cause of kidney failure is critical to\\nproper treatment. A full assessment of the kidneys is neces-\\nsary to determine if the underlying disease is treatable and if\\nthe kidney failure is chronic or acute. X rays,magnetic res-\\nonance imaging(MRI), computed tomography scan (CT),\\nultrasound, renal biopsy, and/or arteriogram of the kidneys\\nmay be used to determine the cause of kidney failure and\\nlevel of remaining kidney function. X rays and ultrasound\\nof the bladder and/or ureters may also be needed.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment for acute kidney failure varies. Treatment\\nis directed to the underlying, primary medical condition\\nthat has triggered kidney failure. Prerenal conditions may\\nbe treated with replacement fluids given through a vein,\\ndiuretics, blood transfusion , or medications. Postrenal\\nconditions and intrarenal conditions may require surgery\\nand/or medication.\\nFrequently, patients in acute kidney failure require\\nhemodialysis, hemofiltration, or peritoneal dialysis to fil-\\nter fluids and wastes from the bloodstream until the pri-\\nmary medical condition can be controlled.\\nHemodialysis\\nHemodialysis involves circulating the patient’s\\nblood outside of the body through an extracorporeal cir-\\ncuit (ECC), or dialysis circuit. The ECC is made up of\\nplastic blood tubing, a filter known as a dialyzer (or arti-\\nficial kidney), and a dialysis machine that monitors and\\nmaintains blood flow and administers dialysate.\\nDialysate is a sterile chemical solution that is used to\\ndraw waste products out of the blood. The patient’s blood\\nleaves the body through the vein and travels through the\\nECC and the dialyzer, where fluid removal takes place.\\nDuring dialysis, waste products in the bloodstream\\nare carried out of the body. At the same time, electrolytes\\nand other chemicals are added to the blood. The purified,\\nchemically-balanced blood is then returned to the body.\\nKEY TERMS\\nBlood urea nitrogen (BUN)—A waste product that\\nis formed in the liver and collects in the blood-\\nstream; patients with kidney failure have high\\nBUN levels.\\nCreatinine —A protein produced by muscle that\\nhealthy kidneys filter out.\\nExtracorporeal —Outside of, or unrelated to, the\\nbody.\\nIschemia—A lack of blood supply to an organ or\\ntissue.\\nNephrotoxic—Toxic, or damaging, to the kidney.\\nRadiocontrast agents —Dyes administered to a\\npatient for the purposes of a radiologic study.\\nSepsis—A bacterial infection of the bloodstream.\\nVasopressors—Medications that constrict the blood\\nvessels.\\nA dialysis “run” typically lasts three to four hours,\\ndepending on the type of dialyzer used and the physical\\ncondition of the patient. Dialysis is used several times a\\nweek until acute kidney failure is reversed.\\nBlood pressure changes associated with hemodialy-\\nsis may pose a risk for patients with heart problems. Peri-\\ntoneal dialysis may be the preferred treatment option in\\nthese cases.\\nHemofiltration\\nHemofiltration, also called continuous renal replace-\\nment therapy (CRRT), is a slow, continuous blood filtra-\\ntion therapy used to control acute kidney failure in criti-\\ncally ill patients. These patients are typically very sick\\nand may have heart problems or circulatory problems.\\nThey cannot handle the rapid filtration rates of hemodial-\\nysis. They also frequently need antibiotics , nutrition ,\\nvasopressors, and other fluids given through a vein to\\ntreat their primary condition. Because hemofiltration is\\ncontinuous, prescription fluids can be given to patients in\\nkidney failure without the risk of fluid overload.\\nLike hemodialysis, hemofiltration uses an ECC. A\\nhollow fiber hemofilter is used instead of a dialyzer to\\nremove fluids and toxins. Instead of a dialysis machine, a\\nblood pump makes the blood flow through the ECC. The\\nvolume of blood circulating through the ECC in hemofil-\\ntration is less than that in hemodialysis. Filtration rates\\nare slower and gentler on the circulatory system.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 45\\nAcute kidney failure\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 45'),\n",

In\\nperitoneal dialysis (PD), the lining of the patient’s\\nabdomen, the peritoneum, acts as a blood filter. A flexible\\ntube-like instrument (catheter) is surgically inserted into\\nthe patient’s abdomen. During treatment, the catheter is\\nused to fill the abdominal cavity with dialysate. Waste\\nproducts and excess fluids move from the patient’s blood-\\nstream into the dialysate solution. After a certain time\\nperiod, the waste-filled dialysate is drained from the\\nabdomen, and replaced with clean dialysate. There are\\nthree type of peritoneal dialysis, which vary according to\\ntreatment time and administration method.\\nPeritoneal dialysis is often the best treatment option\\nfor infants and children. Their small size can make vein\\naccess difficult to maintain. It is not recommended for\\npatients with abdominal adhesions or other abdominal\\ndefects (like a hernia) that might reduce the efficiency of\\nthe treatment. It is also not recommended for patients\\nwho suffer frequent bouts of an inflammation of the\\nsmall pouches in the intestinal tract (diverticulitis).\\nPrognosis\\nBecause many of the illnesses and underlying con-\\nditions that often trigger acute kidney failure are critical,\\nthe prognosis for these patients many times is not good.\\nStudies have estimated overall death rates for acute kid-\\nney failure at 42-88%. Many people, however, die\\nbecause of the primary disease that has caused the kid-\\nney failure. These figures may also be misleading\\nbecause patients who experience kidney failure as a\\nresult of less serious illnesses (like kidney stones or\\ndehydration) have an excellent chance of complete\\nrecovery. Early recognition and prompt, appropriate\\ntreatment are key to patient recovery.\\nUp to 10% of patients who experience acute kidney\\nfailure will suffer irreversible kidney damage. They will\\neventually go on to develop chronic kidney failure or\\nend-stage renal disease. These patients will require long-\\nterm dialysis or kidney transplantation to replace their\\nlost renal functioning.\\nPrevention\\nSince acute kidney failure can be caused by many\\nthings, prevention is difficult. Medications that may\\nimpair kidney function should be given cautiously.\\nPatients with pre-existing kidney conditions who are\\nhospitalized for other illnesses or injuries should be care-\\nfully monitored for kidney failure complications. Treat-\\nments and procedures that may put them at risk for kid-\\nney failure (like diagnostic tests requiring radiocontrast\\nagents or dyes) should be used with extreme caution.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBock, G.

Once the bacteria enter the lymphatic\\nsystem, they multiply rapidly and follow the lymphatic\\nvessel like a highway. The infected lymphatic vessel\\nbecomes inflamed, causing red streaks that are visible\\nbelow the skin surface. The growth of the bacteria occurs\\nso rapidly that the immune system does not respond fast\\nenough to stop the infection.\\nIf left untreated, the bacteria can cause tissue\\ndestruction in the area of the infection. A pus-filled,\\npainful lump called an abscess may be formed in the\\ninfected area. Cellulitis , a generalized infection of the\\nlower skin layers, may also occur. In addition, the bacte-\\nria may invade the bloodstream and cause septicemia.\\nLay people, for that reason, often call the red streaks seen\\nin the skin “blood poisoning.” Septicemia is a very seri-\\nous illness and may be fatal.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAcute lymphangitis is most often caused by the bac-\\nterium Streptococcus pyogenes. This potentially danger-\\nous bacterium also causes strep throat, infections of the\\nheart, spinal cord, and lungs, and in the 1990s has been\\ncalled the “flesh-eating bacterium.” Staphylococci bacte-\\nria may also cause lymphangitis.\\nAlthough anyone can develop lymphangitis, some\\npeople are more at risk. People who have had radical mas-\\ntectomy (removal of a breast and nearby lymph nodes), a\\nleg vein removed for coronary bypass surgery, or recurrent\\nlymphangitis caused by tinea pedis (a fungal infection on\\nthe foot) are at an increased risk for lymphangitis.\\nThe characteristic symptoms of acute lymphangitis\\nare the wide, red streaks which travel from the site of\\ninfection to the armpit or groin. The affected areas are red,\\nswollen, and painful. Blistering of the affected skin may\\noccur. The bacterial infection causes a fever of 100-104°F\\n(38°–40°C).

Antigens from the dead streptococci\\nclump together with the antibodies that killed them.\\nThese clumps are trapped in the kidney tubules, cause the\\ntubules to become inflamed, and impair that organs’ abil-\\nity to filter and eliminate body wastes. The onset of\\nAPSGN usually occurs one to six weeks (average two\\nweeks) after the streptococcal infection.\\nAPSGN is a relatively uncommon disease affecting\\nabout one of every 10,000 people, although four or five\\ntimes that many may actually be affected by it but show\\nno symptoms. APSGN is most prevalent among boys\\nbetween the ages of 3 and 7, but it can occur at any age.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nFrequent sore throats and a history of streptococcal\\ninfection increase the risk of acquiring APSGN. Symp-\\ntoms of APSGN include:\\n• fluid accumulation and tissue swelling (edema) initial-\\nly in the face and around the eyes, later in the legs\\n• low urine output (oliguria)\\n• blood in the urine (hematuria)\\n• protein in the urine (proteinuria)\\n• high blood pressure\\n• joint pain or stiffness\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of APSGN is made by taking the patient’s\\nhistory, assessing his/her symptoms, and performing cer-\\ntain laboratory tests. Urinalysis usually shows blood and\\nprotein in the urine. Concentrations of urea and creati-\\nnine (two waste products normally filtered out of the\\nblood by the kidneys) in the blood are often high, indi-\\ncating impaired kidney function. A reliable, inexpensive\\nblood test called the anti-streptolysin-O test can confirm\\nthat a patient has or has had a streptococcal infection. A\\nthroat culturemay also show the presence of group A\\nbeta-hemolytic streptococci.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of ASPGN is designed to relieve the\\nsymptoms and prevent complications. Some patients are\\nadvised to stay in bed until they feel better and to restrict\\nfluid and salt intake. Antibiotics may be prescribed to\\nkill any lingering streptococcal bacteria, if their presence\\nis confirmed.

(Dissociation is a psychological reaction to trauma\\nin which the mind tries to cope by “sealing off” some\\nfeatures of the trauma from conscious awareness).\\nDescription\\nAcute stress disorder is a new diagnostic category\\nthat was introduced in 1994 to differentiate time-limited\\nreactions to trauma from post-traumatic stress disorder\\n(PTSD).\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAcute stress disorder is caused by exposure to trau-\\nma, which is defined as a stressor that causes intense fear\\nand, usually, involves threats to life or serious injury to\\noneself or others. Examples are rape, mugging, combat,\\nnatural disasters, etc.\\nThe symptoms of stress disorder include a combining\\nof one or more dissociative and anxiety symptoms with\\nthe avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event. Disso-\\nciative symptoms include emotional detachment, tempo-\\nrary loss of memory, depersonalization, and derealization.\\nAnxiety symptoms connected with acute stress disor-\\nder include irritability, physical restlessness, sleep prob-\\nlems, inability to concentrate, and being easily startled.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of acute stress disorder is based on a com-\\nbination of the patient’s history and a physical examina-\\ntion to rule out diseases that can cause anxiety. The\\nKEY TERMS\\nDepersonalization —A dissociative symptom in\\nwhich the patient feels that his or her body is unre-\\nal, is changing, or is dissolving.\\nDerealization —A dissociative symptom in which\\nthe external environment is perceived as unreal.\\nDissociation —A reaction to trauma in which the\\nmind splits off certain aspects of the trauma from\\nconscious awareness. Dissociation can affect the\\npatient’s memory, sense of reality, and sense of\\nidentity.\\nTrauma—In the context of ASD, a disastrous or\\nlife-threatening event.\\nessential feature is a traumatic event within one month of\\nthe onset of symptoms. Other diagnostic criteria include:\\n• The symptoms significantly interfere with normal\\nsocial or vocational functioning\\n• The symptoms last between two days and four weeks.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment for acute stress disorder usually includes\\na combination of antidepressant medications and short-\\nterm psychotherapy.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAcupuncture has been recommended as a treatment\\nfor acute stress disorder. Some other alternative\\napproaches, including meditation , breathing exercises,\\nand yoga, may be helpful when combined with short-\\nterm psychotherapy. Homeopathic treatment and the use\\nof herbal medicine and flower essences also can help the\\nperson with acute stress disorder rebalance on the physi-\\ncal, mental, and emotional levels.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for recovery is influenced by the sever-\\nity and duration of the trauma, the patient’s closeness to it,\\nand the patient’s previous level of functioning. Favorable\\nsigns include a short time period between the trauma and\\nonset of symptoms, immediate treatment, and appropriate\\nsocial support.

The term has\\nbeen partially replaced by the word dependence for sub-\\nstance abuse. Addiction has been extended, however, to\\ninclude mood-altering behaviors or activities. Some\\nresearchers speak of two types of addictions: substance\\naddictions (for example,alcoholism , drug abuse, and\\nsmoking ); and process addictions (for example, gam-\\nbling, spending, shopping, eating, and sexual activity).\\nThere is a growing recognition that many addicts, such as\\npolydrug abusers, are addicted to more than one sub-\\nstance or process.\\nDescription\\nAddiction is one of the most costly public health\\nproblems in the United States. It is a progressive syn-\\ndrome, which means that it increases in severity over\\ntime unless it is treated. Substance abuse is characterized\\nby frequent relapse, or return to the abused substance.\\nSubstance abusers often make repeated attempts to quit\\nbefore they are successful.\\nIn 1995 the economic cost of substance abuse in the\\nUnited States exceeded $414 billion, with health care\\ncosts attributed to substance abuse estimated at more\\nthan $114 billion.\\nBy eighth grade, 52% of adolescents have consumed\\nalcohol, 41% have smoked tobacco, and 20% have\\nsmoked marijuana. Compared to females, males are\\nalmost four times as likely to be heavy drinkers, nearly\\none and a half more likely to smoke a pack or more of\\ncigarettes daily, and twice as likely to smoke marijuana\\nweekly. However, among adolescents these gender dif-\\nferences are decreasing. Although frequent use of tobac-\\nco,cocaine and heavy drinking appears to have remained\\nstable in the 1990s, marijuana use increased.\\nIn 1999, an estimated four million Americans over the\\nage of 12 used prescription pain relievers, sedatives, and\\nstimulants for “nonmedical” reasons during one month.\\nIn the United States, 25% of the population regularly\\nuses tobacco. Tobacco use reportedly kills 2.5 times as\\nmany people each year as alcohol and drug abuse com-\\nbined. According to 1998 data from the World Health\\nOrganization, there were 1.1 billion smokers worldwide\\nand 10,000 tobacco-related deaths per day. Furthermore,\\nin the United States, 43% of children aged 2-11 years are\\nexposed to environmental tobacco smoke, which has\\nbeen implicated in sudden infant death syndrome,l o w\\nbirth weight, asthma, middle ear disease, pneumonia ,\\ncough, and upper respiratory infection.\\nEating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa, bulim-\\nia nervosa , and binge eating, affect over five million\\nAmerican women and men. Fifteen percent of young\\nwomen have substantially disordered attitudes toward\\neating and eating behaviors. More than 1,000 women die\\neach year from anorexia nervosa.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 250\\nAddiction\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 50'),\n",

Some forms of substance abuse and\\ndependence seem to run in families; and this may be the\\nresult of a genetic predisposition, environmental influ-\\nences, or a combination of both.\\nBrain structure and function\\nUsing drugs repeatedly over time changes brain\\nstructure and function in fundamental and long-lasting\\nways. Addiction comes about through an array of\\nchanges in the brain and the strengthening of new memo-\\nry connections. Evidence suggests that those long-lasting\\nbrain changes are responsible for the distortions of cog-\\nnitive and emotional functioning that characterize\\naddicts, particularly the compulsion to use drugs.\\nAlthough the causes of addiction remain the subject of\\nongoing debate and research, many experts now consider\\naddiction to be a brain disease: a condition caused by\\npersistent changes in brain structure and function. How-\\never, having this brain disease does not absolve the\\naddict of responsibility for his or her behavior, but it does\\nexplain why many addicts cannot stop using drugs by\\nsheer force of will alone.\\nSocial learning\\nSocial learning is considered the most important sin-\\ngle factor. It includes patterns of use in the addict’s fami-\\nly or subculture, peer pressure, and advertising or media\\ninfluence.\\nAvailability\\nInexpensive or readily available tobacco, alcohol, or\\ndrugs produce marked increases in rates of addiction.\\nIndividual development\\nBefore the 1980s, the so-called addictive personality\\nwas used to explain the development of addiction. The\\naddictive personality was described as escapist, impul-\\nsive, dependent, devious, manipulative, and self-cen-\\ntered. Many doctors now believe that these character\\ntraits develop in addicts as a result of the addiction,\\nrather than the traits being a cause of the addiction.\\nDiagnosis\\nIn addition to a preoccupation with using and\\nacquiring the abused substance, the diagnosis of addic-\\ntion is based on five criteria:\\n• loss of willpower\\n• harmful consequences\\n• unmanageable lifestyle\\n• tolerance or escalation of use\\n• withdrawal symptoms upon quitting\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 51\\nAddiction\\nCrack users.

This results in decreased production of two\\nimportant chemicals (hormones) normally released by\\nthe adrenal cortex: cortisol and aldosterone.\\nDescription\\nThe adrenals are two glands, each perched on the\\nupper part of the two kidneys. The outer part of the gland\\nis known as the cortex; the inner part is known as the\\nmedulla. Each of these parts of the adrenal gland is\\nresponsible for producing different types of hormones.\\nCortisol is a very potent hormone produced by the\\nadrenal cortex. It is involved in regulating the functioning\\nof nearly every type of organ and tissue throughout the\\nbody, and is considered to be one of the few hormones\\nabsolutely necessary for life. Cortisol is involved in:\\n• the very complex processing and utilization of many nutri-\\nents, including sugars (carbohydrates), fats, and proteins\\n• the normal functioning of the circulatory system and\\nthe heart\\nKEY TERMS\\nGland—A collection of cells whose function is to\\nrelease certain chemicals, or hormones, which are\\nimportant to the functioning of other, sometimes\\ndistantly located, organs or body systems.\\nHormone —A chemical produced in one part of\\nthe body, which travels to another part of the body\\nin order to exert its effect.\\n• the functioning of muscles\\n• normal kidney function\\n• production of blood cells\\n• the normal processes involved in maintaining the skele-\\ntal system\\n• proper functioning of the brain and nerves\\n• the normal responses of the immune system\\nAldosterone, also produced by the adrenal cortex,\\nplays a central role in maintaining the appropriate pro-\\nportions of water and salts in the body. When this bal-\\nance is upset, the volume of blood circulating throughout\\nthe body will fall dangerously low, accompanied by a\\ndrop in blood pressure.\\nAddison’s disease is also called primary adrenocorti-\\ncal insufficiency. In other words, some process interferes\\ndirectly with the ability of the adrenal cortex to produce\\nits hormones. Levels of both cortisol and aldosterone\\ndrop, and numerous functions throughout the body are\\ndisrupted.\\nAddison’s disease occurs in about four in every\\n100,000 people. It strikes both men and women of all ages.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe most common cause of Addison’s disease is the\\ndestruction and/or shrinking (atrophy) of the adrenal\\ncortex. In about 70% of all cases, this atrophy is\\nbelieved to occur due to an autoimmune disorder. In an\\nautoimmune disorder, the immune system of the body,\\nresponsible for identifying foreign invaders such as\\nviruses or bacteria and killing them, accidentally begins\\nto identify the cells of the adrenal cortex as foreign, and\\ndestroy them. In about 20% of all cases, destruction of\\nthe adrenal cortex is caused by tuberculosis . The\\nremaining cases of Addison’s disease may be caused by\\nfungal infections, such as histoplasmosis , coccidiomy-\\ncosis, and cryptococcosis , which affect the adrenal\\ngland by producing destructive, tumor-like masses\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 53\\nAddison’s disease\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 53'),\n",

The most com-\\nmon symptoms include fatigue and loss of energy,\\ndecreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea ,\\nabdominal pain, weight loss, muscle weakness, dizzi-\\nness when standing, dehydration , unusual areas of\\ndarkened (pigmented) skin, and dark freckling. As the\\ndisease progresses, the patient may appear to have very\\ntanned, or bronzed skin, with darkening of the lining of\\nthe mouth, vagina, and rectum, and dark pigmentation\\nof the area around the nipples (aereola). As dehydration\\nbecomes more severe, the blood pressure will continue\\nto drop and the patient will feel increasingly weak and\\nlight-headed. Some patients have psychiatric symp-\\ntoms, including depression and irritability. Women lose\\npubic and underarm hair, and stop having normal men-\\nstrual periods.\\nWhen a patient becomes ill with an infection, or\\nstressed by an injury, the disease may suddenly and\\nrapidly progress, becoming life-threatening. Symptoms\\nof this “Addisonian crisis” include abnormal heart\\nrhythms, severe pain in the back and abdomen, uncon-\\ntrollable nausea and vomiting , a drastic drop in blood\\npressure, kidney failure, and unconsciousness. About\\n25% of all Addison’s disease patients are identified due\\nto the development of Addisonian crisis.\\nDiagnosis\\nMany patients do not recognize the slow progres-\\nsion of symptoms and the disease is ultimately identified\\nwhen a physician notices the areas of increased pigmen-\\ntation of the skin. Once suspected, a number of blood\\ntests can lead to the diagnosis of Addison’s disease. It is\\nnot sufficient to demonstrate low blood cortisol levels,\\nas normal levels of cortisol vary quite widely. Instead,\\npatients are given a testing dose of another hormone\\ncalled corticotropin (ACTH). ACTH is produced in the\\nbody by the pituitary gland, and normally acts by pro-\\nmoting growth within the adrenal cortex and stimulating\\nthe production and release of cortisol. In Addison’s dis-\\nease, even a dose of synthetic ACTH does not increase\\ncortisol levels.\\nTo distinguish between primary adrenocortical\\ninsufficiency (Addison’s disease) and secondary\\nadrenocortical insufficiency (caused by failure of the\\npituitary to produce enough ACTH), levels of ACTH in\\nthe blood are examined. Normal or high levels of\\nACTH indicate that the pituitary is working properly,\\nbut the adrenal cortex is not responding normally to the\\npresence of ACTH. This confirms the diagnosis of\\nAddison’s disease.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of Addison’s disease involves replacing\\nthe missing or low levels of cortisol. In the case of Addis-\\nonian crisis, this will be achieved by injecting a potent\\nform of steroid preparation through a needle placed in a\\nvein (intravenous or IV). Dehydration and salt loss will\\nalso be treated by administering carefully balanced solu-\\ntions through the IV . Dangerously low blood pressure\\nmay require special medications to safely elevate it until\\nthe steroids take effect.\\nPatients with Addison’s disease will need to take a\\nsteroid preparation (hydrocortisone) and a replacement\\nfor aldosterone (fludrocortisone) by mouth for the rest of\\ntheir lives. When a patient has an illness which causes\\nnausea and vomiting (such that they cannot hold down\\ntheir medications), he or she will need to enter a medical\\nfacility where IV medications can be administered.\\nWhen a patient has any kind of infection or injury, the\\nnormal dose of hydrocortisone will need to be doubled.\\nPrognosis\\nPrognosis for patients appropriately treated with\\nhydrocortisone and aldosterone is excellent. These\\npatients can expect to enjoy a normal lifespan. Without\\ntreatment, or with substandard treatment, patients are\\nalways at risk of developing Addisonian crisis.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nWilliams, Gordon H., and Robert G.

The tonsils\\nbelow are clearly visible behind the back teeth; the ade-\\nnoids lie just above them and are hidden from view by the\\npalate. Together these four arsenals of immune defense\\nguard the major entrance to the body from foreign\\ninvaders—the germs we breathe and eat. In contrast to the\\nrest of the body’s tissues, lymphoid tissue reaches its\\ngreatest size in mid-childhood and recedes thereafter. In\\nthis way children are best able to develop the immunities\\nthey need to survive in a world full of infectious diseases.\\nBeyond its normal growth pattern, lymphoid tissue\\ngrows excessively (hypertrophies) during an acute infec-\\ntion, as it suddenly increases its immune activity to fight\\noff the invaders. Often it does not completely return to its\\nformer size. Each subsequent infection leaves behind a\\nlarger set of tonsils and adenoids. To make matters\\nworse, the sponge-like structure of these hypertrophied\\nglands can produce safe havens for germs where the\\nbody cannot reach and eliminate them. Before antibi-\\notics and the reduction in infectious childhood diseases\\nover the past few generations, tonsils and adenoids\\ncaused greater health problems.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nMost tonsil and adenoid hypertrophy is simply\\ncaused by the normal growth pattern for that type of tis-\\nsue. Less often, the hypertrophy is due to repeated throat\\ninfections by cold viruses,strep throat, mononucleosis,\\nand in times gone by, diphtheria . The acute infections\\nare usually referred to as tonsillitis, the adenoids getting\\nlittle recognition because they cannot be seen without\\nspecial instruments. Symptoms include painful, bright\\nred, often ulcerated tonsils, enlargement of lymph nodes\\n(glands) beneath the jaw,fever, and general discomfort.\\nAfter the acute infection subsides, symptoms are gen-\\nerated simply by the size of the glands. Extremely large\\ntonsils can impair breathing and swallowing, although that\\nis quite rare. Large adenoids can impair nose breathing\\nand require a child to breathe through the mouth. Because\\nthey encircle the only connection between the middle ear\\nand the eustachian tube, hypertrophied adenoids can also\\nobstruct it and cause middle ear infections.\\nKEY TERMS\\nEustacian tube—A tube connecting the middle ear\\nwith the back of the nose, allowing air pressure to\\nequalize within the ear whenever it opens, such as\\nwith yawning.\\nHyperplastic—Overgrown.\\nHypertrophy—Overgrowth.\\nStrep throat—An infection of the throat caused by\\nbacteria of the Streptococcus family, which causes\\ntonsillitis.\\nUlcerated—Damaged so that the surface tissue is\\nlost and/or necrotic (dead).\\nDiagnosis\\nA simple tongue blade depressing the tongue allows\\nan adequate view of the tonsils. Enlarged tonsils may\\nhave deep pockets (crypts) containing dead tissue\\n(necrotic debris). Viewing adenoids requires a small mir-\\nror or fiberoptic scope. A child with recurring middle ear\\ninfections may well have large adenoids. A throat cul-\\nture or mononucleosis test will usually reveal the identi-\\nty of the germ.\\nTreatment\\nIt used to be standard practice to remove tonsils\\nand/or adenoids after a few episodes of acute throat or ear\\ninfection. The surgery is called tonsillectomy and ade-\\nnoidectomy(T and A). Opinion changed as it was realized\\nthat this tissue is beneficial to the development of immuni-\\nty. For instance, children without tonsils and adenoids pro-\\nduce only half the immunity to oral polio vaccine. In addi-\\ntion, treatment of ear and throat infections with antibiotics\\nand of recurring ear infections with surgical drainage\\nthrough the ear drum (tympanostomy) has greatly reduced\\nthe incidence of surgical removal of these lymph glands.\\nAlternative treatment\\nThere are many botanical/herbal remedies that can\\nbe used alone or in formulas to locally assist the tonsils\\nand adenoids in their immune function at the opening of\\nthe oral cavity and to tone these glands. Keeping the\\nEustachian tubes open is an important contribution to\\noptimal function in the tonsils and adenoids.

About 47 dif-\\nferent types have been identified since then, and about\\nhalf of them are believed to cause human diseases. Infants\\nand children are most commonly affected by adenovirus-\\nes. Adenovirus infections can occur throughout the year,\\nbut seem to be most common from fall to spring.\\nAdenoviruses are responsible for 3-5% of acute res-\\npiratory infections in children and 2% of respiratory ill-\\nnesses in civilian adults. They are more apt to cause\\ninfection among military recruits and other young people\\nwho live in institutional environments. Outbreaks among\\nchildren are frequently reported at boarding schools and\\nsummer camps.\\nAcquired immunity\\nMost children have been infected by at least one\\nadenovirus by the time they reach school age. Most\\nadults have acquired immunity to multiple adenovirus\\ntypes due to infections they had as children.\\nIn one mode of adenovirus infection (called lytic\\ninfection because it destroys large numbers of cells), ade-\\nnoviruses kill healthy cells and replicate up to one mil-\\nlion new viruses per cell killed (of which 1-5% are infec-\\ntious). People with this kind of infection feel sick. In\\nchronic or latent infection, a much smaller number of\\nviruses are released and healthy cells can multiply more\\nrapidly than they are destroyed. People who have this\\nkind of infection don’t seem to be sick. This is probably\\nwhy many adults have immunity to adenoviruses without\\nrealizing they have been infected.\\nChildhood infections\\nIn children, adenoviruses most often cause acute\\nupper respiratory infections with fever and runny nose.\\nAdenovirus types 1, 2, 3,5, and 6 are responsible for\\nmost of these infections. Occasionally more serious\\nlower respiratory diseases, such as pneumonia , may\\noccur.\\nAdenoviruses also cause acute pharyngoconjunctival\\nfever in children. This disease is most often caused by\\ntypes 3 and 7. Symptoms, which appear suddenly and\\nusually disappear in less than a week, include:\\n• inflammation of the lining of the eyelid (conjunctivitis)\\n•f e v e r\\n• sore throat (pharyngitis)\\n• runny nose\\n• inflammation of lymph glands in the neck (cervical\\nadenitis)\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 256\\nAdenovirus infections\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 56'),\n",

A\\nchild who has hemorrhagic cystitis has bloody urine for\\nabout three days, and invisible traces of blood can be\\nfound in the urine a few days longer. The child will feel\\nthe urge to urinate frequently—but find it difficult to do\\nso—for about the same length of time.\\nAdult infections\\nIn adults, the most frequently reported adenovirus\\ninfection is acute respiratory disease (ARD, caused by\\ntypes 4 and 7) in military recruits. Influenza-like symp-\\ntoms including fever, sore throat, runny nose, and cough\\nare almost always present; weakness, chills, headache ,\\nand swollen lymph glands in the neck may also occur.\\nThe symptoms typically last three to five days.\\nEpidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC, caused by ade-\\nnovirus types 8, 19, and 37) was first seen in shipyard\\nworkers whose eyes had been slightly injured by chips of\\nrust or paint. This inflammation of tissues lining the eye-\\nlid and covering the front of the eyeball can also be\\ncaused by using contaminated contact lens solutions or\\nby drying the hands or face with a towel used by some-\\none who has this infection.\\nThe inflamed, sticky eyelids characteristic of con-\\njunctivitis develop 4-24 days after exposure and last\\nbetween one and four weeks.

The\\nadrenal gland is a hormone producing endocrine gland\\nwith two main parts, the cortex and the medulla. The\\nmain hormone of the adrenal cortex is cortisol and the\\nmain hormone of the adrenal medulla is epinephrine.\\nWhen tumors develop in the adrenal gland, they secrete\\nexcess amounts of these hormones. A cancer that arises\\nin the adrenal cortex is called an adrenocortical carcino-\\nma and can produce high blood pressure, weight gain,\\nexcess body hair, weakening of the bones and diabetes. A\\ncancer in the adrenal medulla is called a pheochromocy-\\ntoma and can cause high blood pressure, headache, pal-\\npitations, and excessive perspiration. Although these can-\\ncers can happen at any age, most occur in young adults.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nIt is not known what causes adrenal gland cancer,\\nbut some cases are associated with hereditary diseases.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 59\\nAdrenal gland cancer\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 59'),\n",

Sometimes, one or both of\\nthe adrenal glands becomes enlarged or overactive, pro-\\nducing more than the usual amount of androgens. The\\nexcess androgens create masculine characteristics.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nIn infants and children, adrenal virilism is usually\\nthe result of adrenal gland enlargement that is present at\\nbirth. This is called congenital adrenal hyperplasia .\\nThe cause is usually a genetic problem that leads to\\nsevere enzyme deficiencies. In rare cases, adrenal viril-\\nism is caused by an adrenal gland tumor. The tumor can\\nbe benign (adrenal adenoma) or cancerous (adrenal car-\\ncinoma). Sometimes virilism is caused by a type of\\ntumor on a woman’s ovary (arrhenoblastoma).\\nNewborn girls with adrenal virilism have external\\nsex organs that seem to be a mixture of male and female\\norgans (called female pseudohermaphrodism).

They may also develop a deeper voice, a more\\nprominent Adam’s apple, and other masculine signs.\\nDiagnosis\\nEndocrinologists, doctors who specialize in the\\ndiagnosis and treatment of glandular disorders, have the\\nmost expertise to deal with adrenal virilization.

These tests mea-\\nsure the concentration of different hormones. Different\\nabnormalities of the adrenal gland produce a different\\npattern of hormonal abnormalities. These tests can also\\nhelp determine if the problem is adrenal or ovarian. If a\\ntumor is suspected, special x rays may be done to visual-\\nize the tumor in the body. Final diagnosis may depend on\\nobtaining a tissue sample from the tumor (biopsy), and\\nexamining it under a microscope in order to verify its\\ncharacteristics.\\nTreatment\\nAdrenal virilism caused by adrenal hyperplasia is\\ntreated with daily doses of a glucocorticoid. Usually\\nprednisone is the drug of choice, but in infants hydrocor-\\ntisone is usually given. Laboratory tests are usually need-\\ned from time to time to adjust the dosage. Girls with\\npseudohermaphrodism may require surgery to make their\\nexternal sex organs appear more normal.

Lampert\\nAdrenalectomy\\nDefinition\\nAdrenalectomy is the surgical removal of one or\\nboth of the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are paired\\nendocrine glands, one located above each kidney, that\\nproduce hormones such as epinephrine, norepinephrine,\\nandrogens, estrogens, aldosterone, and cortisol. Adrena-\\nlectomy is usually performed by conventional (open)\\nsurgery, but in selected patients surgeons may use\\nlaparoscopy. With laparoscopy, adrenalectomy can be\\naccomplished through four very small incisions.\\nPurpose\\nAdrenalectomy is usually advised for patients with\\ntumors of the adrenal glands. Adrenal gland tumors may\\nbe malignant or benign, but all typically excrete excessive\\namounts of one or more hormones. A successful proce-\\ndure will aid in correcting hormone imbalances, and may\\nalso remove cancerous tumors that can invade other parts\\nof the body. Occasionally, adrenalectomy may be recom-\\nmended when hormones produced by the adrenal glands\\naggravate another condition such as breast cancer.\\nPrecautions\\nThe adrenal glands are fed by numerous blood ves-\\nsels, so surgeons need to be alert to extensive bleeding\\nduring surgery. In addition, the adrenal glands lie close to\\none of the body’s major blood vessels (the vena cava),\\nand to the spleen and the pancreas. The surgeon needs to\\nremove the gland(s) without damaging any of these\\nimportant and delicate organs.\\nDescription\\nOpen adrenalectomy\\nThe surgeon may operate from any of four direc-\\ntions, depending on the exact problem and the patient’s\\nbody type.\\nIn the anterior approach, the surgeon cuts into the\\nabdominal wall. Usually the incision will be horizontal,\\njust under the rib cage. If the surgeon intends to operate\\non only one of the adrenal glands, the incision will run\\nunder just the right or the left side of the rib cage. Some-\\ntimes a vertical incision in the middle of the abdomen\\nprovides a better approach, especially if both adrenal\\nglands are involved.\\nIn the posterior approach, the surgeon cuts into the\\nback, just beneath the rib cage. If both glands are to be\\nremoved, an incision is made on each side of the body.\\nThis approach is the most direct route to the adrenal\\nglands, but it does not provide quite as clear a view of the\\nsurrounding structures as the anterior approach.\\nIn the flank approach, the surgeon cuts into the\\npatient’s side. This is particularly useful in massively obese\\npatients. If both glands need to be removed, the surgeon\\nmust remove one gland, repair the surgical wound, turn the\\npatient onto the other side, and repeat the entire process.\\nThe last approach involves an incision into the chest\\ncavity, either with or without part of the incision into the\\nabdominal cavity. It is used when the surgeon anticipates\\na very large tumor, or if the surgeon needs to examine or\\nremove nearby structures as well.\\nLaparoscopic adrenalectomy\\nThis technique does not require the surgeon to open\\nthe body cavity. Instead, four small incisions (about 1/2\\nin diameter each) are made into a patient’s flank, just\\nunder the rib cage. A laparoscope, which enables the sur-\\ngeon to visualize the inside of the abdominal cavity on a\\ntelevision monitor, is placed through one of the incisions.\\nThe other incisions are for tubes that carry miniaturized\\nversions of surgical tools. These tools are designed to be\\noperated by manipulations that the surgeon makes out-\\nside the body.\\nPreparation\\nMost aspects of preparation are the same as in other\\nmajor operations. In addition, hormone imbalances are\\noften a major challenge. Whenever possible, physicians\\nwill try to correct hormone imbalances through medica-\\ntion in the days or weeks before surgery. Adrenal tumors\\nmay cause other problems such as hypertension or inad-\\nequate potassium in the blood, and these problems also\\nshould be resolved if possible before surgery is per-\\nformed. Therefore, a patient may take specific medicines\\nfor days or weeks before surgery.\\nMost adrenal tumors can be imaged very well with a\\nCT scan or MRI, and benign tumors tend to look differ-\\nent on these tests than do cancerous tumors. Surgeons\\nmay order a CT scan, MRI, or scintigraphy (viewing of\\nthe location of a tiny amount of radioactive agent) to help\\nlocate exactly where the tumor is.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 63\\nAdrenalectomy\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 63'),\n",

The most common cause of this\\ndisease is an autoimmune disorder. The immune sys-\\ntem normally fights foreign invaders in the body like\\nbacteria. In an autoimmune disorder, the immune sys-\\ntems attacks the body. In this case, the immune system\\nproduces antibodies that attack the adrenal glands.\\nAddison’s disease generally progresses slowly, with\\nsymptoms developing gradually over months or years.\\nHowever, acute episodes, called Addisonian crises, are\\nbrought on by infection, injury, or other stresses.

Approximately one in\\n100,000 people is affected by ALD. There are three basic\\nforms of ALD: childhood, adult-onset, and neonatal. The\\nchildhood form of the disease is the classical form and is\\nthe most severe. Childhood ALD is progressive and usu-\\nally leads to total disability or death. It affects only boys\\nbecause the genetic defect is sex-linked (carried on the X\\nchromosome). Onset usually occurs between ages four\\nand ten and can include many different symptoms, not all\\nof which appear together. The most common symptoms\\nare behavioral problems and poor memory. Other symp-\\ntoms frequently seen are loss of vision, seizures, poorly\\narticulated speech, difficulty swallowing, deafness, prob-\\nlems with gait and coordination,fatigue, increased skin\\npigmentation, and progressive dementia.\\nThe adult-onset form of the disease, also called\\nadrenomyeloneuropathy, is milder, progresses slowly, is\\nusually associated with a normal life span, and usually\\nappears between ages 21-35. Symptoms may include\\nprogressive stiffness, weakness, or paralysis of the lower\\nlimbs and loss of coordination. Brain function deteriora-\\ntion may also been seen. Women who are carriers of the\\ndisease occasionally experience the same symptoms, as\\nwell as others, including ataxia, hypertonia (excessive\\nmuscle tone), mild peripheral neuropathy, and urinary\\nproblems. The neonatal form affects both male and\\nfemale infants and may produce mental retardation ,\\nfacial abnormalities, seizures, retinal degeneration, poor\\nmuscle tone, enlarged liver, and adrenal dysfunction.\\nNeonatal ALD usually progresses rapidly.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe genetic defect in ALD causes a decrease in the\\nability to degrade very long chain fatty acids. These build\\nup in the adrenal glands, brain, plasma, and fibroblasts.\\nThe build-up of very long chain fatty acids interferes\\nwith the ability of the adrenal gland to convert choles-\\nterol into steroids and causes demyelination of nerves in\\nthe white matter of the brain. Demyelinated nerve cells\\nare unable to function properly.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is made based on observed symptoms, a\\nbiochemical test, and a family history. The biochemical\\ntest detects elevated levels of very long chain fatty acids\\nin samples from amniocentesis, chorionic villi, plasma,\\nred blood cells, or fibroblasts. A family history may indi-\\ncate the likelihood of ALD because the disease is carried\\non the X-chromosome by the female lineage of families.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment for all forms of ALD consists of treating\\nthe symptoms and supporting the patient with physical\\ntherapy, psychological counseling, and special education\\nin some cases. There is no cure for this disease, and there\\nare no drugs that can reverse demyelination of nerve and\\nbrain cells. Dietary measures consist of reducing the\\nintake of foods high in fat, which are a source of very\\nlong chain fatty acids. A mixture called Lorenzo’s Oil\\nhas been shown to reduce the level of long chain fatty\\nacids if used long term; however, the rate of myelin loss\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 266\\nAdrenoleukodystrophy3\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 66'),\n",

Lohr, PhD\\nAdrenomyeloneuropathy see Adrenoleuko-\\ndystrophy\\nAdult respiratory distress\\nsyndrome\\nDefinition\\nAdult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), also\\ncalled acute respiratory distress syndrome, is a type of\\nlung (pulmonary) failure that may result from any dis-\\nease that causes large amounts of fluid to collect in the\\nlungs. ARDS is not itself a specific disease, but a syn-\\ndrome, a group of symptoms and signs that make up one\\nof the most important forms of lung or respiratory fail-\\nure. It can develop quite suddenly in persons whose\\nlungs have been perfectly normal. Very often ARDS is a\\ntrue medical emergency. The basic fault is a breakdown\\nof the barrier, or membrane, that normally keeps fluid\\nfrom leaking out of the small blood vessels of the lung\\ninto the breathing sacs (the alveoli).\\nDescription\\nAnother name for ARDS is shock lung. Its formal\\nname is misleading, because children, as well as adults,\\nmay be affected. In the lungs the smallest blood vessels,\\nor capillaries, make contact with the alveoli, tiny air sacs\\nat the tips of the smallest breathing tubes (the bronchi).\\nThis is the all-important site where oxygen passes from\\nair that is inhaled to the blood, which carries it to all parts\\nof the body. Any form of lung injury that damages this\\npoint of contact, called the alveolo-capillary junction,\\nwill allow blood and tissue fluid to leak into the alveoli,\\neventually filling them so that air cannot enter. The result\\nis the type of breathing distress called ARDS. ARDS is\\none of the major causes of excess fluid in the lungs, the\\nother being heart failure.\\nAlong with fluid there is a marked increase in\\ninflamed cells in the lungs. There also is debris left over\\nfrom damaged lung cells, and fibrin, a semi-solid materi-\\nal derived from blood in the tissues. Typically these\\nmaterials join together with large molecules in the blood\\n(proteins), to form hyaline membranes. (These mem-\\nbranes are very prominent in premature infants who\\ndevelop respiratory distress syndrome; it is often called\\nhyaline membrane disease.) If ARDS is very severe or\\nlasts a long time, the lungs do not heal, but rather become\\nscarred, a process known as fibrosis. The lack of a nor-\\nmal amount of oxygen causes the blood vessels of the\\nlung to become narrower, and in time they, too, may\\nbecome scarred and filled with clotted blood. The lungs\\nas a whole become very “stiff,” and it becomes much\\nharder for the patient to breathe.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nA very wide range of diseases or toxic substances,\\nincluding some drugs, can cause ARDS. They include:\\n• Breathing in (aspiration) of the stomach contents when\\nregurgitated, or salt water or fresh water from nearly\\ndrowning.\\n• Inhaling smoke, as in a fire; toxic materials in the air,\\nsuch as ammonia or hydrocarbons; or too much oxy-\\ngen, which itself can injure the lungs.\\n• Infection by a virus or bacterium, or sepsis, a wide-\\nspread infection that gets into the blood.\\n• Massive trauma, with severe injury to any part of the\\nbody.\\n• Shock with persistently low blood pressure may not in\\nitself cause ARDS, but it can be an important factor.\\n• A blood clotting disorder called disseminated intravas-\\ncular coagulation, in which blood clots form in vessels\\nthroughout the body, including the lungs.\\n• A large amount of fat entering the circulation and trav-\\neling to the lungs, where it lodges in small blood ves-\\nsels, injuring the cells lining the vessel walls.\\n• An overdose of a narcotic drug, a sedative, or, rarely,\\naspirin.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 67\\nAdult respiratory distress syndrome\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 67'),\n",

Convulsions also may cause some cases.\\nUsually ARDS develops within one to two days of the\\noriginal illness or injury. The person begins to take rapid\\nbut shallow breaths. The doctor who listens to the patient’s\\nchest with a stethoscope may hear “crackling” or wheez-\\ning sounds. The low blood oxygen content may cause the\\nskin to appear mottled or even blue. As fluid continues to\\nfill the breathing sacs, the patient may have great trouble\\nbreathing, take very rapid breaths, and gasp for air.\\nDiagnosis\\nA simple test using a device applied to the ear will\\nshow whether the blood is carrying too little oxygen, and\\nthis can be confirmed by analyzing blood taken from an\\nartery. The chest x ray may be normal in the early stages,\\nbut, in a short time, fluid will be seen where it does not\\nbelong. The two lungs are about equally affected. A heart\\nof normal size indicates that the problem actually is ARDS\\nand not heart failure. Another way a physician can distin-\\nguish between these two possibilities is to place a catheter\\nKEY TERMS\\nAlveoli—The tiny air sacs at the ends of the breath-\\ning tubes of the lung where oxygen normally is\\ntaken up by the capillaries to enter the circulation.\\nAspiration—The process in which solid food, liq-\\nuids, or secretions that normally are swallowed\\nare, instead, breathed into the lungs.\\nCapillaries —The smallest arteries which, in the\\nlung, are located next to the alveoli so that they\\ncan pick up oxygen from inhaled air.\\nFace mask—The simplest way of delivering a high\\nlevel of oxygen to patients with ARDS or other\\nlow-oxygen conditions.\\nSteroids —A class of drugs resembling normal\\nbody substances that often help control inflamma-\\ntion in the body tissues.\\nVentilator —A mechanical device that can take\\nover the work of breathing for a patient whose\\nlungs are injured or are starting to heal.\\ninto a vein and advance it into the main artery of the lung.\\nIn this way, the pressure within the pulmonary capillaries\\ncan be measured. Pressure within the pulmonary capillar-\\nies is elevated in heart failure, but normal in ARDS.\\nTreatment\\nThe three main goals in treating patients with ARDS\\nare:\\n• To treat whatever injury or disease has caused ARDS.\\nExamples are: to treat septic infection with the proper\\nantibiotics, and to reduce the level of oxygen therapy if\\nARDS has resulted from a toxic level of oxygen.\\n• To control the process in the lungs that allows fluid to\\nleak out of the blood vessels. At present there is no cer-\\ntain way to achieve this. Certain steroid hormones have\\nbeen tried because they can combat inflammation, but\\nthe actual results have been disappointing.\\n• To make sure the patient gets enough oxygen until the\\nlung injury has had time to heal. If oxygen delivered by\\na face mask is not enough, the patient is placed on a\\nventilator, which takes over breathing, and, through a\\ntube placed in the nose or mouth (or an incision in the\\nwindpipe), forces oxygen into the lungs. This treatment\\nmust be closely supervised, and the pressure adjusted\\nso that too much oxygen is not delivered.\\nPatients with ARDS should be cared for in an inten-\\nsive care unit, where experienced staff and all needed\\nequipment are available. Enough fluid must be provided,\\nby vein if necessary, to prevent dehydration . Also, the\\npatient’s nutritional state must be maintained, again by\\nvein, if oral intake is not sufficient.\\nPrognosis\\nIf the patient’s lung injury does not soon begin to\\nheal, the lack of sufficient oxygen can injure other organs,\\nsuch as the kidneys. There always is a risk that bacterial\\npneumoniawill develop at some point. Without prompt\\ntreatment, as many as 90% of patients with ARDS can be\\nexpected to die. With modern treatment, however, about\\nhalf of all patients will survive. Those who do live usually\\nrecover completely, with little or no long-term breathing\\ndifficulty. Lung scarring is a risk after a long period on a\\nventilator, but it may improve in the months after the\\npatient is taken off ventilation. Whether a particular\\npatient will recover depends to a great extent on whether\\nthe primary disease that caused ARDS to develop in the\\nfirst place can be effectively treated.\\nPrevention\\nThe only way to prevent ARDS is to avoid those dis-\\neases and harmful conditions that damage the lung.

In the Western countries,\\nthe length of life is often into the 70s. The upward limit of\\nthe life span, however, can be as high as 120 years. During\\nthe latter half of life, an individual is more prone to have\\nproblems with the various functions of the body and to\\ndevelop any number of chronic or fatal diseases. The car-\\ndiovascular, digestive, excretory, nervous, reproductive\\nand urinary systems are particularly affected. The most\\ncommon diseases of aging include Alzheimer’s, arthritis,\\ncancer, diabetes, depression, and heart disease.\\nDescription\\nHuman beings reach a peak of growth and develop-\\nment around the time of their mid 20s. Aging is the normal\\ntransition time after that flurry of activity. Although there\\nare quite a few age-related changes that tax the body, dis-\\nability is not necessarily a part of aging. Health and\\nlifestyle factors together with the genetic makeup of the\\nindividual, and determines the response to these changes.\\nBody functions that are most often affected by age include:\\n• Hearing, which declines especially in relation to the\\nhighest pitched tones.\\n• The proportion of fat to muscle, which may increase by\\nas much as 30%. Typically, the total padding of body\\nfat directly under the skin thins out and accumulates\\naround the stomach. The ability to excrete fats is\\nimpaired, and therefore the storage of fats increases,\\nincluding cholesterol and fat-soluble nutrients.\\n• The amount of water in the body decreases, which there-\\nfore decreases the absorption of water-soluble nutrients.\\nAlso, there is less saliva and other lubricating fluids.\\n• The liver and the kidneys cannot function as efficiently,\\nthus affecting the elimination of wastes.\\n• A decrease in the ease of digestion, with a decrease in\\nstomach acid production.\\n• A loss of muscle strength and coordination, with an\\naccompanying loss of mobility, agility, and flexibility.\\n• A decline in sexual hormones and sexual functioning.\\n• A decrease in the sensations of taste and smell.\\n• Changes in the cardiovascular and respiratory systems,\\nleading to decreased oxygen and nutrients throughout\\nthe body.\\n• Decreased functioning of the nervous system so that\\nnerve impulses are not transmitted as efficiently, reflex-\\nes are not as sharp, and memory and learning are\\ndiminished.\\n• A decrease in bone strength and density.\\n• Hormone levels, which gradually decline. The thyroid\\nand sexual hormones are particularly affected.\\n• Declining visual abilities. Age-related changes may\\nlead to diseases such as macular degeneration.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 69\\nAging\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 69'),\n",

It may be that several factors work\\ntogether or that one particular factor is at work more than\\nothers in a given individual.\\n• Programmed senescence, or aging clock, theory. The\\naging of the cells of each individual is programmed into\\nthe genes, and there is a preset number of possible reju-\\nvenations in the life of a given cell. When cells die at a\\nrate faster than they are replaced, organs do not func-\\ntion properly, and they are soon unable to maintain the\\nfunctions necessary for life.\\n• Genetic theory. Human cells maintain their own seed of\\ndestruction at the level of the chromosomes.\\n• Connective tissue, or cross-linking theory. Changes in\\nthe make-up of the connective tissue alter the stability\\nof body structures, causing a loss of elasticity and func-\\ntioning, and leading to symptoms of aging.\\n• Free-radical theory. The most commonly held theory of\\naging, it is based on the fact that ongoing chemical\\nreactions of the cells produce free radicals. In the pres-\\nence of oxygen, these free radicals cause the cells of the\\nbody to break down. As time goes on, more cells die or\\nlose the ability to function, and the body soon ceases to\\nfunction as a whole.\\n• Immunological theory. There are changes in the immune\\nsystem as it begins to wear out, and the body is more\\nprone to infections and tissue damage, which may finally\\ncause death. Also, as the system breaks down, the body\\nis more apt to have autoimmune reactions, in which the\\nbody’s own cells are mistaken for foreign material and\\nare destroyed or damaged by the immune system.\\nDiagnosis\\nMany problems can arise due to age-related changes\\nin the body. Although there is no one test to be given, a\\nthorough physical exam and a basic blood screening and\\nblood chemistry panel can point to areas in need of fur-\\nther attention. When older people become ill, the first\\nsigns of disease are often nonspecific. Further exams\\nshould be conducted if any of the following occur:\\n• diminished or lack of desire for food\\n• increasing confusion\\n• failure to thrive\\n• urinary incontinence\\n• dizziness\\n• weight loss\\n• falling\\nTreatment\\nFor the most part, doctors prescribe medications to\\ncontrol the symptoms and diseases of aging. In the Unit-\\ned States, about two-thirds of people 65 and over take\\nmedications for various complaints. More women than\\nmen use these medications. The most common drugs\\nused by the elderly are painkillers,diuretics or water\\npills, sedatives, cardiac drugs, antibiotics , and mental\\nhealth drugs.\\nEstrogen replacement therapy (ERT) is commonly\\nprescribed to postmenopausal women for symptoms of\\naging. It is often used in conjunction with progesterone.\\nERT functions to help keep bones strong, reduce risk of\\nheart disease, restore vaginal lubrication, and to improve\\nskin elasticity. Evidence suggests that it may also help\\nmaintain mental functions.\\nExpected results\\nAging is unavoidable, but major physical impair-\\nment is not. People can lead a healthy, disability-free life\\nwell through their later years. A well established support\\nsystem of family, friends, and health care providers,\\ntogether with focus on good nutrition and lifestyle\\nhabits and good stress management, can prevent disease\\nand lessen the impact of chronic conditions.\\nAlternative treatment\\nNutritional supplements\\nConsumption of a high–quality multivitamin is rec-\\nommended. Common nutritional deficiencies connected\\nwith aging include B vitamins , vitamins A and C, folic\\nacid, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron, chromium, and\\ntrace minerals. Since stomach acids may be decreased, it\\nis suggested that the use of a powdered multivitamin for-\\nmula in gelatin capsules be used, as this form is the easi-\\nest to digest. Such formulas may also contain enzymes\\nfor further help with digestion.\\nAntioxidants can help to neutralize damage by the\\nfree radical actions thought to contribute to problems of\\naging. They are also helpful in preventing and treating\\ncancer and in treating cataracts and glaucoma.

People with phobias feel dread or panic when they\\nface certain objects, situations, or activities. People with\\nagoraphobia frequently also experience panic attacks, but\\npanic attacks, or panic disorder , are not a requirement\\nfor a diagnosis of agoraphobia. The defining feature of\\nagoraphobia is anxiety about being in places from which\\nescape might be embarrasing or difficult, or in which\\nhelp might be unavailable. The person suffering from\\nagoraphobia usually avoids the anxiety-provoking situa-\\ntion and may become totally housebound.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAgoraphobia is the most common type of phobia, and\\nit is estimated to affect between 5-12% of Americans within\\ntheir lifetime. Agoraphobia is twice as common in women\\nas in men and usually strikes between the ages of 15-35.\\nThe symptoms of the panic attacks which may\\naccompany agoraphobia vary from person to person, and\\nmay include trembling, sweating, heart palpitations (a\\nfeeling of the heart pounding against the chest), jitters,\\nfatigue, tingling in the hands and feet, nausea, a rapid\\npulse or breathing rate, and a sense of impending doom.\\nAgoraphobia and other phobias are thought to be the\\nresult of a number of physical and environmental factors.\\nFor instance, they have been associated with biochemical\\nimbalances, especially related to certain neurotransmit-\\nters (chemical nerve messengers) in the brain. People\\nwho have a panic attack in a given situation (e.g., a shop-\\nping mall) may begin to associate the panic with that sit-\\nuation and learn to avoid it. According to some theories,\\nirrational anxiety results from unresolved emotional con-\\nflicts. All of these factors may play a role to varying\\nextents in different cases of agoraphobia.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 272\\nAgoraphobia\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 72'),\n",

The doctor can diagnose\\nthe underlying panic or anxiety disorder and make sure\\nthe symptoms aren’t related to some other underlying\\nmedical condition.\\nThe doctor makes the diagnosis of agoraphobia\\nbased primarily on the patient’s description of his or her\\nsymptoms. The person with agoraphobia experiences\\nanxiety in situations where escape is difficult or help is\\nunavailable—or in certain situations, such as being alone.\\nWhile many people are somewhat apprehensive in these\\nsituations, the hallmark of agoraphobia is that a person’s\\nactive avoidance of the feared situation impairs his or her\\nability to work, socialize, or otherwise function.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment for agoraphobia usually consists of both\\nmedication and psychotherapy. Usually, patients can\\nbenefit from certain antidepressants, such as amitripty-\\nline (Elavil), or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,\\nsuch as paroxetine (Paxil), fluoxetine (Prozac), or sertra-\\nline (Zoloft). In addition, patients may manage panic\\nattacks in progress with certain tranquilizers called ben-\\nzodiazepines , such as alprazolam (Xanax) or clon-\\nazepam (Klonipin).\\nThe mainstay of treatment for agoraphobia and other\\nphobias is cognitive behavioral therapy. A specific tech-\\nnique that is often employed is called desensitization.\\nThe patient is gradually exposed to the situation that usu-\\nally triggers fear and avoidance, and, with the help of\\nbreathing or relaxation techniques, learns to cope with\\nthe situation. This helps break the mental connection\\nbetween the situation and the fear, anxiety, or panic.\\nPatients may also benefit from psychodynamically ori-\\nented psychotherapy, discussing underlying emotional\\nconflicts with a therapist or support group.\\nPrognosis\\nWith proper medication and psychotherapy, 90% of\\npatients will find significant improvement in their symp-\\ntoms.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nHallowell, Edward M.

Of these patients, 44%\\nare gay or bisexual men, 20% are heterosexual intravenous\\ndrug users, and 17% are women. In addition, approximate-\\nly 1,000-2,000 children are born each year with HIV infec-\\ntion. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that\\n33 million adults and 1.3 million children worldwide were\\nliving with HIV/AIDS as of 1999 with 5.4 million being\\nnewly infected that year. Most of these cases are in the\\ndeveloping countries of Asia and Africa.\\nRisk factors\\nAIDS can be transmitted in several ways. The risk\\nfactors for HIV transmission vary according to category:\\n• Sexual contact. Persons at greatest risk are those who\\ndo not practice safe sex, those who are not monoga-\\nmous, those who participate in anal intercourse, and\\nthose who have sex with a partner with symptoms of\\nadvanced HIV infection and/or other sexually trans-\\nmitted diseases (STDs). In the United States and\\nEurope, most cases of sexually transmitted HIV infec-\\ntion have resulted from homosexual contact, whereas in\\nAfrica, the disease is spread primarily through sexual\\nintercourse among heterosexuals.\\n• Transmission in pregnancy. High-risk mothers include\\nwomen married to bisexual men or men who have an\\nabnormal blood condition called hemophilia and\\nrequire blood transfusions, intravenous drug users, and\\nwomen living in neighborhoods with a high rate of HIV\\ninfection among heterosexuals. The chances of trans-\\nmitting the disease to the child are higher in women in\\nadvanced stages of the disease. Breast feeding increases\\nthe risk of transmission by 10-20%. The use of zidovu-\\ndine (AZT) during pregnancy, however, can decrease\\nthe risk of transmission to the baby.\\n• Exposure to contaminated blood or blood products.\\nWith the introduction of blood product screening in the\\nmid-1980s, the incidence of HIV transmission in blood\\ntransfusions has dropped to one in every 100,000 trans-\\nfused. With respect to HIV transmission among drug\\nabusers, risk increases with the duration of using injec-\\ntions, the frequency of needle sharing, the number of\\npersons who share a needle, and the number of AIDS\\ncases in the local population.\\n• Needle sticks among health care professionals. Present\\nstudies indicate that the risk of HIV transmission by a nee-\\ndle stick is about one in 250. This rate can be decreased if\\nthe injured worker is given AZT, an anti-retroviral medica-\\ntion, in combination with other medication.\\nHIV is not transmitted by handshakes or other casu-\\nal non-sexual contact, coughing or sneezing, or by blood-\\nsucking insects such as mosquitoes.\\nAIDS in women\\nAIDS in women is a serious public health concern.\\nWomen exposed to HIV infection through heterosexual\\ncontact are the most rapidly growing risk group in the\\nUnited States population. The percentage of AIDS cases\\ndiagnosed in women has risen from 7% in 1985 to 23% in\\n1999.

As of 2000, it was estimated that\\n87% of HIV-positive women are of childbearing age; 41%\\nof them are drug abusers. Between 15-30% of children born\\nto HIV-positive women will be infected with the virus.\\nAIDS is one of the 10 leading causes of death in chil-\\ndren between one and four years of age. The interval\\nbetween exposure to HIV and the development of AIDS is\\nshorter in children than in adults. Infants infected with HIV\\nhave a 20-30% chance of developing AIDS within a year\\nand dying before age three. In the remainder, AIDS pro-\\ngresses more slowly; the average child patient survives to\\nseven years of age. Some survive into early adolescence.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nBecause HIV destroys immune system cells, AIDS\\nis a disease that can affect any of the body’s major organ\\nsystems. HIV attacks the body through three disease\\nprocesses: immunodeficiency, autoimmunity, and ner-\\nvous system dysfunction.\\nImmunodeficiency describes the condition in which\\nthe body’s immune response is damaged, weakened, or is\\nnot functioning properly. In AIDS, immunodeficiency\\nresults from the way that the virus binds to a protein called\\nCD4, which is primarily found on the surface of certain\\nsubtypes of white blood cells called helper T cells or CD4\\ncells. After the virus has attached to the CD4 receptor, the\\nvirus-CD4 complex refolds to uncover another receptor\\ncalled a chemokine receptor that helps to mediate entry of\\nthe virus into the cell. One chemokine receptor in particu-\\nlar, CCR5, has gotten recent attention after studies showed\\nthat defects in its structure (caused by genetic mutations)\\ncause the progression of AIDS to be prevented or slowed.\\nScientists hope that this discovery will lead to the develop-\\nment of drugs that trigger an artificial mutation of the\\nCCR5 gene or target the CCR5 receptor.\\nOnce HIV has entered the cell, it can replicate intra-\\ncellularly and kill the cell in ways that are still not com-\\npletely understood. In addition to killing some lympho-\\ncytes directly, the AIDS virus disrupts the functioning of\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 75\\nAIDS\\nMature HIV-1 viruses (above) and the lymphocyte from which they emerged (below).Two immature viruses can be seen bud-\\nding on the surface of the lymphocyte (right of center).(Photograph by Scott Camazir, Photo Researchers, Inc.

Because the immune system\\ncells are destroyed, many different types of infections\\nand cancers that take advantage of a person’s weakened\\nimmune system (opportunistic) can develop.\\nAutoimmunity is a condition in which the body’s\\nimmune system produces antibodies that work against its\\nown cells. Antibodies are specific proteins produced in\\nresponse to exposure to a specific, usually foreign, protein\\nor particle called an antigen. In this case, the body pro-\\nduces antibodies that bind to blood platelets that are nec-\\nessary for proper blood clotting and tissue repair. Once\\nbound, the antibodies mark the platelets for removal from\\nthe body, and they are filtered out by the spleen. Some\\nAIDS patients develop a disorder, called immune-related\\nthrombocytopeniapurpura (ITP), in which the number\\nof blood platelets drops to abnormally low levels.\\nAs of 2000, researchers do not know precisely how\\nHIV attacks the nervous system since the virus can cause\\ndamage without infecting nerve cells directly. One theory\\nis that, once infected with HIV , one type of immune sys-\\ntem cell, called a macrophage, begins to release a toxin\\nthat harms the nervous system.\\nThe course of AIDS generally progresses through\\nthree stages, although not all patients will follow this\\nprogression precisely:\\nAcute retroviral syndrome\\nAcute retroviral syndrome is a term used to describe\\na group of symptoms that can resemble mononucleosis\\nand that may be the first sign of HIV infection in 50-70%\\nof all patients and 45-90% of women. Most patients are\\nnot recognized as infected during this phase and may not\\nseek medical attention. The symptoms may include\\nfever, fatigue, muscle aches, loss of appetite, digestive\\ndisturbances, weight loss, skin rashes, headache , and\\nchronically swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy).\\nApproximately 25-33% of patients will experience a\\nform of meningitis during this phase in which the mem-\\nbranes that cover the brain and spinal cord become\\ninflamed. Acute retroviral syndrome develops between\\none and six weeks after infection and lasts for two to\\nthree weeks. Blood tests during this period will indicate\\nthe presence of virus (viremia) and the appearance of the\\nviral p24 antigen in the blood.\\nLatency period\\nAfter the HIV virus enters a patient’s lymph nodes\\nduring the acute retroviral syndrome stage, the disease\\nbecomes latent for as many as 10 years or more before\\nsymptoms of advanced disease develop. During latency,\\nthe virus continues to replicate in the lymph nodes, where\\nit may cause one or more of the following conditions:\\nPERSISTENT GENERALIZED LYMPHADENOPATHY (PGL).\\nPersistent generalized lymphadenopathy, or PGL, is a con-\\ndition in which HIV continues to produce chronic painless\\nswellings in the lymph nodes during the latency period.\\nThe lymph nodes that are most frequently affected by PGL\\nare those in the areas of the neck, jaw, groin, and armpits.\\nPGL affects between 50-70% of patients during latency.\\nCONSTITUTIONAL SYMPTOMS. Many patients will\\ndevelop low-grade fevers, chronic fatigue, and general\\nweakness. HIV may also cause a combination of food\\nmalabsorption, loss of appetite, and increased metabo-\\nlism that contribute to the so-called AIDS wasting or\\nwasting syndrome.\\nOTHER ORGAN SYSTEMS. At any time during the\\ncourse of HIV infection, patients may suffer from a yeast\\ninfection in the mouth called thrush, open sores or ulcers,\\nor other infections of the mouth; diarrhea and other gas-\\ntrointestinal symptoms that cause malnutrition and\\nweight loss; diseases of the lungs and kidneys; and\\ndegeneration of the nerve fibers in the arms and legs.\\nHIV infection of the nervous system leads to general loss\\nof strength, loss of reflexes, and feelings of numbness or\\nburning sensations in the feet or lower legs.\\nLate-stage disease (AIDS)\\nAIDS is usually marked by a very low number of\\nCD4+ lymphocytes, followed by a rise in the frequency\\nof opportunistic infections and cancers. Doctors monitor\\nthe number and proportion of CD4+ lymphocytes in the\\npatient’s blood in order to assess the progression of the\\ndisease and the effectiveness of different medications.\\nAbout 10% of infected individuals never progress to this\\novert stage of the disease and are referred to as nonpro-\\ngressors.\\nOPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS. Once the patient’s\\nCD4+ lymphocyte count falls below 200 cells/mm\\n3\\n, he or\\nshe is at risk for a variety of opportunistic infections. The\\ninfectious organisms may include the following:\\n• Fungi. The most common fungal disease associated\\nwith AIDS is Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP).\\nPCP is the immediate cause of death in 15-20% of\\nAIDS patients. It is an important measure of a patient’s\\nprognosis. Other fungal infections include a yeast\\ninfection of the mouth (candidiasis or thrush) and\\ncryptococcal meningitis.\\n• Protozoa. Toxoplasmosis is a common opportunistic\\ninfection in AIDS patients that is caused by a proto-\\nzoan. Other diseases in this category include isoporiasis\\nand cryptosporidiosis.\\n• Mycobacteria.

AIDS patients are highly vulnerable to\\ncytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV),\\nvaricella zoster virus (VZV), and Epstein-Barr virus\\n(EBV) infections. Another virus, JC virus, causes pro-\\ngressive destruction of brain tissue in the brain stem, cere-\\nbrum, and cerebellum (multifocal leukoencephalopathy\\nor PML), which is regarded as an AIDS-defining illness\\nby the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\nAIDS DEMENTIA COMPLEX AND NEUROLOGIC COM-\\nPLICATIONS. AIDS dementia complex is usually a late\\ncomplication of the disease. It is unclear whether it is\\ncaused by the direct effects of the virus on the brain or by\\nintermediate causes. AIDS dementia complex is marked\\nby loss of reasoning ability, loss of memory, inability to\\nconcentrate, apathy and loss of initiative, and unsteadi-\\nness or weakness in walking. Some patients also develop\\nseizures. There are no specific treatments for AIDS\\ndementia complex.\\nMUSCULOSKELETAL COMPLICATIONS. Patients in\\nlate-stage AIDS may develop inflammations of the mus-\\ncles, particularly in the hip area, and may have arthritis-\\nlike pains in the joints.\\nORAL SYMPTOMS.

These tests are also used to detect viruses\\nand bacterium other than HIV and AIDS.\\nOTHER LABORATORY TESTS. In addition to diagnos-\\ntic blood tests, there are other blood tests that are used to\\ntrack the course of AIDS in patients that have already\\nbeen diagnosed. These include blood counts, viral load\\ntests, p24 antigen assays, and measurements of /H92522-\\nmicroglobulin (/H92522M).\\nDoctors will use a wide variety of tests to diagnose the\\npresence of opportunistic infections, cancers, or other dis-\\nease conditions in AIDS patients. Tissue biopsies, samples of\\ncerebrospinal fluid, and sophisticated imaging techniques,\\nsuch as magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) and computed\\ntomography scans(CT) are used to diagnose AIDS-related\\ncancers, some opportunistic infections, damage to the central\\nnervous system, and wasting of the muscles. Urine and stool\\nsamples are used to diagnose infections caused by parasites.\\nAIDS patients are also given blood tests for syphilis and\\nother sexually transmitted diseases.\\nDiagnosis in children\\nDiagnostic blood testing in children older than 18\\nmonths is similar to adult testing, with ELISA screening\\nconfirmed by Western blot. Younger infants can be diag-\\nnosed by direct culture of the HIV virus, PCR testing,\\nand p24 antigen testing.\\nIn terms of symptoms, children are less likely than\\nadults to have an early acute syndrome. They are, howev-\\ner, likely to have delayed growth, a history of frequent\\nillness, recurrent ear infections, a low blood cell count,\\nfailure to gain weight, and unexplained fevers. Children\\nwith AIDS are more likely to develop bacterial infec-\\ntions, inflammation of the lungs, and AIDS-related brain\\ndisorders than are HIV-positive adults.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment for AIDS covers four considerations:\\nTREATMENT OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS AND\\nMALIGNANCIES. Most AIDS patients require complex\\nlong-term treatment with medications for infectious dis-\\neases. This treatment is often complicated by the devel-\\nopment of resistance in the disease organisms. AIDS-\\nrelated malignancies in the central nervous system are\\nusually treated with radiation therapy . Cancers else-\\nwhere in the body are treated with chemotherapy.\\nPROPHYLACTIC TREATMENT FOR OPPORTUNISTIC\\nINFECTIONS. Prophylactic treatment is treatment that is\\ngiven to prevent disease. AIDS patients with a history of\\nPneumocystispneumonia; with CD4+ counts below 200\\ncells/mm\\n3\\nor 14% of lymphocytes; weight loss; or thrush\\nshould be given prophylactic medications. The three\\ndrugs given are trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, dap-\\nsone, or pentamidine in aerosol form.\\nANTI-RETROVIRAL TREATMENT. In recent years\\nresearchers have developed drugs that suppress HIV\\nreplication, as distinct from treating its effects on the\\nbody. These drugs fall into three classes:\\n• Nucleoside analogues. These drugs work by interfering\\nwith the action of HIV reverse transcriptase inside infect-\\ned cells, thus ending the virus’ replication process. These\\ndrugs include zidovudine (sometimes called azidothymi-\\ndine or AZT), didanosine (ddI), zalcitabine (ddC), stavu-\\ndine (d4T), lamivudine (3TC), and abacavir (ABC).\\n• Protease inhibitors. Protease inhibitors can be effective\\nagainst HIV strains that have developed resistance to\\nnucleoside analogues, and are often used in combination\\nwith them. These compounds include saquinavir, riton-\\navir, indinavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir, and lopinavir.\\n• Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. This is\\na new class of antiretroviral agents. Three are available,\\nnevirapine, which was approved first, delavirdine and\\nefavirin.\\nTreatment guidelines for these agents are in constant\\nchange as new medications are developed and intro-\\nduced. Two principles currently guide doctors in working\\nout drug regimens for AIDS patients: using combinations\\nof drugs rather than one medication alone; and basing\\ntreatment decisions on the results of the patient’s viral\\nload tests.\\nSTIMULATION OF BLOOD CELL PRODUCTION.\\nBecause many patients with AIDS suffer from abnormal-\\nly low levels of both red and white blood cells, they may\\nbe given medications to stimulate blood cell production.\\nEpoetin alfa (erythropoietin) may be given to anemic\\npatients. Patients with low white blood cell counts may\\nbe given filgrastim or sargramostim.\\nTreatment in women\\nTreatment of pregnant women with HIV is particu-\\nlarly important in that anti-retroviral therapy has been\\nshown to reduce transmission to the infant by 65%.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative treatments for AIDS can be grouped into\\ntwo categories: those intended to help the immune sys-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 280\\nAIDS\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 80'),\n",

Treatments that\\nmay enhance the function of the immune system include\\nChinese herbal medicine and western herbal medicine,\\nmacrobiotic and other special diets, guided imagery and\\ncreative visualization, homeopathy, and vitamin therapy.\\nPain control therapies include hydrotherapy , reiki,\\nacupuncture, meditation, chiropractic treatments, and\\ntherapeutic massage. Alternative therapies can also be\\nused to help with side effects of the medications used in\\nthe treatment of AIDS.\\nPrognosis\\nAt the present time, there is no cure for AIDS.\\nTreatment stresses aggressive combination drug\\ntherapy for those patients with access to the expensive\\nmedications and who tolerate them adequately. The use\\nof these multi-drug therapies has significantly reduced\\nthe numbers of deaths, in this country, resulting from\\nAIDS. The data is still inconclusive, but the potential\\nexists to possibly prolong life indefinitely using these\\nand other drug therapies to boost the immune system,\\nkeep the virus from replicating, and ward off opportunis-\\ntic infections and malignancies.\\nPrognosis after the latency period depends on the\\npatient’s specific symptoms and the organ systems\\naffected by the disease. Patients with AIDS-related lym-\\nphomas of the central nervous system die within two to\\nthree months of diagnosis; those with systemic lym-\\nphomas may survive for eight to ten months.\\nPrevention\\nAs of 2001, there is no vaccine effective against\\nAIDS. Several vaccines are currently being investigated,\\nhowever, both to prevent initial HIV infection and as a\\ntherapeutic treatment to prevent HIV from progressing to\\nfull-blown AIDS.\\nIn the meantime, there are many things that can be\\ndone to prevent the spread of AIDS:\\n• Be monogamous and practice safe sex. Individuals\\nmust be instructed in the proper use of condoms and\\nurged to practice safe sex. Besides avoiding the risk of\\nHIV infection, condoms are successful in preventing\\nother sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted preg-\\nnancies. Before engaging in a sexual relationship with\\nsomeone, get tested for HIV infection.\\n• Avoid needle sharing among intravenous drug users.\\n• Although blood and blood products are carefully moni-\\ntored, those individuals who are planning to undergo\\nmajor surgery may wish to donate blood ahead of time\\nto prevent a risk of infection from a blood transfusion.\\n• Healthcare professionals must taken all necessary pre-\\ncautions by wearing gloves and masks when handling\\nbody fluids and preventing needle-stick injuries.\\n• If you suspect that you may have become infected, get\\ntested for HIV infection. If treated aggressively early\\non, the development of AIDS may be postponed indefi-\\nnitely. If HIV infection is confirmed, it is also vital to\\nlet your sexual partners know so that they can be tested\\nand, if necessary, receive medical attention.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nEarly HIV Infection Guideline Panel.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 95}, page_content='AIDS tests\\nDefinition\\nAIDS tests, short for acquired immunodeficiency\\nsyndrome tests, cover a number of different procedures\\nused in the diagnosis and treatment of HIV patients. These\\ntests are sometimes called AIDS serology tests. Serology\\nis the branch of immunology that deals with the contents\\nand characteristics of blood serum. Serum is the clear light\\nyellow part of blood that remains liquid when blood cells\\nform a clot. AIDS serology evaluates the presence of\\nhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in blood\\nserum and its effects on each patient’s immune system.\\nPurpose\\nAIDS serology serves several different purposes.\\nSome AIDS tests are used to diagnose patients or con-\\nfirm a diagnosis; others are used to measure the progres-\\nsion of the disease or the effectiveness of specific treat-\\nment regimens. Some AIDS tests can also be used to\\nscreen blood donations for safe use in transfusions.\\nIn order to understand the different purposes of the\\nblood tests used with AIDS patients, it is helpful to\\nunderstand how HIV infection affects human blood and\\nthe immune system. HIV is a retrovirus that enters the\\nblood stream of a new host in the following ways:\\n• by sexual contact\\n• by contact with infected body fluids (such as blood and\\nurine)\\n• by transmission during pregnancy,o r\\n• through transfusion of infected blood products\\nA retrovirus is a virus that contains a unique enzyme\\ncalled reverse transcriptase that allows it to replicate with-\\nin new host cells. The virus binds to a protein called CD4,\\nwhich is found on the surface of certain subtypes of white\\nblood cells, including helper T cells, macrophages, and\\nmonocytes. Once HIV enters the cell, it can replicate and\\nkill the cell in ways that are still not completely under-\\nstood. In addition to killing some lymphocytes directly, the\\nAIDS virus disrupts the functioning of the remaining CD4\\ncells. CD4 cells ordinarily produce a substance called\\ninterleukin-2 (IL-2), which stimulates other cells (T cells\\nand B cells) in the human immune system to respond to\\ninfections. Without the IL-2, T cells do not reproduce as\\nthey normally would in response to the HIV virus, and B\\ncells are not stimulated to respond to the infection.\\nPrecautions\\nIn some states such as New York, a signed consent\\nform is needed in order to administer an AIDS test. As\\nwith all blood tests, healthcare professionals should\\nalways wear latex gloves and to avoid being pricked by\\nthe needle used in drawing blood for the tests. Also, it\\nmay be difficult to get blood from a habitual intravenous\\ndrug user due to collapsed veins.\\nDescription\\nDiagnostic tests\\nDiagnostic blood tests for AIDS are usually given to\\npersons in high-risk populations who may have been\\nexposed to HIV or who have the early symptoms of\\nAIDS. Most persons infected with HIV will develop a\\ndetectable level of antibody within three months of infec-\\ntion. The condition of testing positive for HIV antibody\\nin the blood is called seroconversion, and persons who\\nhave become HIV-positive are called seroconverters.\\nIt is possible to diagnose HIV infection by isolating\\nthe virus itself from a blood sample or by demonstrating\\nthe presence of HIV antigen in the blood. Viral culture,\\nhowever, is expensive, not widely available, and slow—it\\ntakes 28 days to complete the viral culture test. More\\ncommon are blood tests that work by detecting the pres-\\nence of antibodies to the HIV virus. These tests are inex-\\npensive, widely available, and accurate in detecting\\n99.9% of AIDS infections when used in combination to\\nscreen patients and confirm diagnoses.\\nENZYME-LINKED IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAY (ELISA).\\nThis type of blood test is used to screen blood for trans-\\nfusions as well as diagnose patients. An ELISA test for\\nHIV works by attaching HIV antigens to a plastic well or\\nbeads. A sample of the patient’s blood serum is added,\\nand excess proteins are removed. A second antibody cou-\\npled to an enzyme is added, followed by addition of a\\nsubstance that will cause the enzyme to react by forming\\na color. An instrument called a spectrophotometer can\\nmeasure the color. The name of the test is derived from\\nthe use of the enzyme that is coupled or linked to the sec-\\nond antibody.\\nThe latest generation of ELISA tests are 99.5% sen-\\nsitive to HIV . Occasionally, the ELISA test will be posi-\\ntive for a patient without symptoms of AIDS from a low-\\nrisk group. Because this result is likely to be a false-posi-\\ntive, the ELISA must be repeated on the same sample of\\nthe patient’s blood. If the second ELISA is positive, the\\nresult should be confirmed by the Western blot test.\\nWESTERN BLOT (IMMUNOBLOT). The Western blot\\nor immunoblot test is used as a reference procedure to\\nconfirm the diagnosis of AIDS. In Western blot testing,\\nHIV antigen is purified by electrophoresis (large protein\\nmolecules are suspended in a gel and separated from one\\nanother by running an electric current through the gel).\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 282\\nAIDS tests\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 82'),\n",

The patient’s serum is reacted against\\nthe filter, followed by treatment with developing chemi-\\ncals that allow HIV antibody to show up as a colored\\npatch or blot. A commercially produced Western blot test\\nfor HIV-1 is now available. It consists of a prefabricated\\nstrip that is incubated with a sample of the patient’s blood\\nserum and the developing chemicals. About nine different\\nHIV-1 proteins can be detected in the blots.\\nWhen used in combination with ELISA testing,\\nWestern blot testing is 99.9% specific. It can, however,\\nyield false negatives in patients with very early HIV\\ninfection and in those infected by HIV-2. In some\\npatients the Western blot yields indeterminate results.\\nIMMUNOFLUORESCENCE ASSAY (IFA). This method\\nis sometimes used to confirm ELISA results instead of\\nWestern blotting. An IFA test detects the presence of\\nHIV antibody in a sample of the patient’s serum by mix-\\ning HIV antigen with a fluorescent chemical, adding the\\nblood sample, and observing the reaction under a micro-\\nscope with ultraviolet light.\\nPOLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (PCR). This test is\\nused to evaluate the very small number of AIDS patients\\nwith false-negative ELISA and Western blot tests. These\\npatients are sometimes called antibody-negative asympto-\\nmatic (without symptoms) carriers, because they do not\\nhave any symptoms of AIDS and there is no detectable\\nquantity of antibody in the blood serum. Antibody-nega-\\ntive asymptomatic carriers may be responsible for the\\nvery low ongoing risk of HIV infection transmitted by\\nblood transfusions. It is estimated that the risk is between\\n1 in 10,000 and 1 in 100,000 units of transfused blood.\\nThe polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test can mea-\\nsure the presence of viral nucleic acids in the patient’s\\nblood even when there is no detectable antibody to HIV .\\nThis test works by amplifying the presence of HIV nucle-\\nic acids in a blood sample. Numerous copies of a gene are\\nmade by separating the two strands of DNA containing\\nthe gene segment, marking its location, using DNA poly-\\nmerase to make a copy, and then continuously replicating\\nthe copies. It is questionable whether PCR will replace\\nWestern blotting as the method of confirming AIDS diag-\\nnoses. Although PCR can detect the low number of per-\\nsons (1%) with HIV infections that have not yet generated\\nan antibody response to the virus, the overwhelming\\nmajority of infected persons will be detected by ELISA\\nscreening within one to three months of infection. In\\naddition, PCR testing is based on present knowledge of\\nthe genetic sequences in HIV . Since the virus is continual-\\nly generating new variants, PCR testing could yield a\\nfalse negative in patients with these new variants.\\nIn 1999, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\\n(FDA) approved an HIV home testing kit. The kit contains\\nmultiple components, including material for specimen col-\\nlection, a mailing envelope to send the specimen to a labo-\\nratory for analysis, and provides pre- and post-test coun-\\nseling. It uses a finger prick process for blood collection.\\nThe results are obtained by the purchaser through a toll\\nfree telephone number using a personal identification\\nnumber (PIN). Post test counseling is provided over the\\ntelephone by a licensed counselor. The only kit approved\\nby the FDA as of 2001 was the Home Access test system.\\nPrognostic tests\\nBlood tests to evaluate patients already diagnosed\\nwith HIV infection are as important as the diagnostic\\ntests. Because AIDS has a long latency period, some per-\\nsons may be infected with the virus for 10 years or longer\\nbefore they develop symptoms of AIDS. These patients\\nare sometimes called antibody-positive asymptomatic\\ncarriers. Prognostic tests also help drug researchers eval-\\nuate the usefulness of new medications in treating AIDS.\\nBLOOD CELL COUNTS. Doctors can measure the\\nnumber or proportion of certain types of cells in an AIDS\\npatient’s blood to see whether and how rapidly the dis-\\nease is progressing, or whether certain treatments are\\nhelping the patient.

CD4 is a receptor for the HIV virus. When the\\nHIV virus infects cells with CD4 surface proteins, it\\ndepletes the number of T cells, B cells, natural killer\\ncells, and monocytes in the patient’s blood. Most of\\nthe damage to an AIDS patient’s immune system is\\ndone by the virus’ destruction of CD4+ lympho-\\ncytes. CD4 is sometimes called the T4 antigen.\\nComplete blood count (CBC) —A routine analysis\\nperformed on a sample of blood taken from the\\npatient’s vein with a needle and vacuum tube. The\\nmeasurements taken in a CBC include a white blood\\ncell count, a red blood cell count, the red cell distri-\\nbution width, the hematocrit (ratio of the volume of\\nthe red blood cells to the blood volume), and the\\namount of hemoglobin (the blood protein that car-\\nries oxygen). CBCs are a routine blood test used for\\nmany medical reasons and are not used only for\\nAIDS patients.

A second\\nantibody coupled to an enzyme is added, followed\\nby a chemical that will cause a color reaction that\\ncan be measured by a special instrument.\\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV)—A transmis-\\nsible retrovirus that causes AIDS in humans. Two\\nforms of HIV are now recognized: HIV-1, which caus-\\nes most cases of AIDS in Europe, North and South\\nAmerica, and most parts of Africa; and HIV-2, which\\nis chiefly found in West African patients. HIV-2, dis-\\ncovered in 1986, appears to be less virulent than HIV-\\n1, but may also have a longer latency period.\\nImmunofluorescent assay (IFA) —A blood test\\nsometimes used to confirm ELISA results instead of\\nusing the Western blotting.

This blood\\ncell count is considered the most accurate indicator\\nfor the presence of an opportunistic infection in an\\nAIDS patient. The absolute CD4+ lymphocyte count\\nis obtained by multiplying the patient’s white blood\\ncell count (WBC) by the percentage of lymphocytes\\namong the white blood cells, and multiplying the\\nresult by the percentage of lymphocytes bearing the\\nCD4+ marker.

In addition, the p24 assay is sometimes useful in\\ndetecting HIV infection before seroconversion. Howev-\\ner, p24 is consistently present in only 25% of persons\\ninfected with HIV .\\nGENOTYPIC DRUG RESISTANCE TEST. Genotypic\\ntesting can help determine whether specific gene muta-\\ntions, common in people with HIV , are causing drug\\nresistance and drug failure. The test looks for specific\\ngenetic mutations of within the virus that are known to\\ncause resistance to certain drugs used in HIV treatment.\\nFor example the drug 3TC, also known as lamivudine\\n(Epivir), is not effective against strains of HIV that have\\na mutation at a particular position on the reverse tran-\\nscriptase protein—amino acid 184—known as M184V\\n(M/L50478V , methionine to valine). So if the genotypic resis-\\ntance test shows a mutation at position M184V , it is like-\\nly that person is resistant to 3TC and not likely to\\nrespond to 3TC treatment. Genotypic tests are only\\neffective if the person is already taking antiviral medica-\\ntion and if the viral load is greater than 1,000 copies per\\nmilliliter (mL) of blood. The cost of the test, usually\\nbetween $300 and $500, is usually now covered by\\nmany insurance plans.\\nPHENOTYPIC DRUG RESISTANCE TESTING. Pheno-\\ntypic testing directly measures the sensitivity of a\\npatient’s HIV to particular drugs and drug combinations.\\nTo do this, it measures the concentration of a drug\\nrequired to inhibit viral replication in the test tube. This\\nis the same method used by researchers to determine\\nwhether a drug might be effective against HIV before\\nusing it in human clinical trials. Phenotypic testing is a\\nmore direct measurement of resistance than genotypic\\ntesting. Also, unlike genotypic testing, phenotypic test-\\ning does not require a high viral load but it is recom-\\nmended that persons already be taking antiretroviral\\ndrugs. The cost is between $700 and $900 and is now\\ncovered by many insurance plans.\\nAIDS serology in children\\nChildren born to HIV-infected mothers may acquire\\nthe infection through the mother’s placenta or during the\\nbirth process. Public health experts recommend the test-\\ning and monitoring of all children born to mothers with\\nHIV . Diagnostic testing in children older than 18 months\\nis similar to adult testing, with ELISA screening con-\\nfirmed by Western blot. Younger infants can be diagnosed\\nby direct culture of the HIV virus, PCR testing, and p24\\nantigen testing. These techniques allow a pediatrician to\\nidentify 50% of infected children at or near birth, and\\n95% of cases in infants three to six months of age.\\nPreparation\\nPreparation and aftercare are important parts of AIDS\\ndiagnostic testing. Doctors are now advised to take the\\npatient’s emotional, social, economic, and other circum-\\nstances into account and to provide counseling before and\\nafter testing. Patients are generally better able to cope with\\nthe results if the doctor has spent some time with them\\nbefore the blood test explaining the basic facts about HIV\\ninfection and testing. Many doctors now offer this type of\\ninformational counseling before performing the tests.\\nAftercare\\nIf the test results indicate that the patient is HIV- pos-\\nitive, he or she will need counseling, information, referral\\nfor treatment, and support. Doctors can either counsel the\\npatient themselves or invite an experienced HIV coun-\\nselor to discuss the results of the blood tests with the\\npatient. They will also assess the patient’s emotional and\\npsychological status, including the possibility of violent\\nbehavior and the availability of a support network.\\nRisks\\nThe risks of AIDS testing are primarily related to\\ndisclosure of the patient’s HIV status rather than to any\\nphysical risks connected with blood testing. Some\\npatients are better prepared to cope with a positive diag-\\nnosis than others, depending on their age, sex, health,\\nresources, belief system, and similar factors.\\nNormal results\\nNormal results for ELISA, Western blot, IFA, and\\nPCR testing are negative for HIV antibody.\\nNormal results for blood cell counts:\\n• WBC differential: Total lymphocytes 24-44% of the\\nwhite blood cells.\\n• Hematocrit: 40-54% in men; 37-47% in women.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 286\\nAIDS tests\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 86'),\n",

It is probably the most specific test for\\nliver damage. However, the severity of the liver damage\\nis not necessarily shown by the ALT test, since the\\namount of dead liver tissue does not correspond to higher\\nALT levels. Also, patients with normal, or declining,\\nALT levels may experience serious liver damage without\\nan increase in ALT.\\nNevertheless, ALT is widely used, and useful,\\nbecause ALT levels are elevated in most patients with\\nliver disease. Although ALT levels do not necessarily\\nindicate the severity of the damage to the liver, they may\\nindicate how much of the liver has been damaged. ALT\\nlevels, when compared to the levels of a similar enzyme,\\naspartate aminotransferase (AST), may provide impor-\\ntant clues to the nature of the liver disease. For example,\\nwithin a certain range of values, a ratio of 2:1 or greater\\nfor AST: ALT might indicate that a patient suffers from\\nalcoholic liver disease. Other diagnostic data may be\\ngleaned from ALT tests to indicate abnormal results.\\nPreparation\\nNo special preparations are necessary for this test.\\nAftercare\\nThis test involves blood being drawn, probably from\\na vein in the patient’s elbow. The patient should keep the\\nwound from the needle puncture covered (with a ban-\\ndage) until the bleeding stops. Patients should report any\\nunusual symptoms to their physician.\\nNormal results\\nNormal values vary from laboratory to laboratory,\\nand should be available to your physician at the time of\\nthe test. An informal survey of some laboratories indi-\\ncates many laboratories find values from approximately\\nseven to 50 IU/L to be normal.\\nAbnormal results\\nLow levels of ALT (generally below 300 IU/L) may\\nindicate any kind of liver disease. Levels above 1,000\\nIU/L generally indicate extensive liver damage from tox-\\nins or drugs, viral hepatitis, or a lack of oxygen (usually\\nresulting from very low blood pressure or a heart\\nattack). A briefly elevated ALT above 1,000 IU/L that\\nresolves in 24-48 hours may indicate a blockage of the\\nbile duct. More moderate levels of ALT (300-1,000IU/L)\\nmay support a diagnosis of acute or chronic hepatitis.\\nIt is important to note that persons with normal liv-\\ners may have slightly elevated levels of ALT.

Many types of albinism\\nexist, all of which involve lack of pigment in varying\\ndegrees. The condition, which is found in all races, may\\nbe accompanied by eye problems and may lead to skin\\ncancerlater in life.\\nDescription\\nAlbinism is a rare disorder found in fewer than five\\npeople per 100,000 in the United States and Europe.\\nOther parts of the world have a much higher rate; for\\nexample, albinism is found in about 20 out of every\\n100,000 people in southern Nigeria.\\nThere are 10 types of the most common form of the\\ncondition, known as “oculocutaneous albinism,” which\\naffects the eyes, hair, and skin. In its most severe form,\\nhair and skin remain pure white throughout life. People\\nwith a less severe form are born with white hair and\\nskin, which turn slightly darker as they age. Everyone\\nwith oculocutaneous albinism experiences abnormal\\nflickering eye movements (nystagmus ) and sensitivity\\nto bright light. There may be other eye problems as\\nwell, including poor vision and crossed or “lazy” eyes\\n(strabismus).\\nThe second most common type of the condition is\\nknown as “ocular” albinism, in which only the eyes lack\\ncolor; skin and hair are normal. There are five forms of\\nocular albinism; some types cause more problems—\\nespecially eye problems—than others.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 288\\nAlbinism\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 88'),\n",

Turkington\\nAlbuterol see Bronchodilators\\nAlcohol-related \\nneurologic disease\\nDefinition\\nAlcohol, or ethanol, is a poison with direct toxic\\neffects on nerve and muscle cells. Depending on which\\nnerve and muscle pathways are involved, alcohol can\\nhave far-reaching effects on different parts of the brain,\\nperipheral nerves, and muscles, with symptoms of mem-\\nory loss, incoordination, seizures, weakness, and senso-\\nry deficits. These different effects can be grouped in\\nthree main categories: (1) intoxication due to the acute\\neffects of ethanol, (2) withdrawal syndrome from sud-\\ndenly stopping drinking, and (3) disorders related to\\nlong-term or chronic alcohol abuse. Alcohol-related\\nneurologic disease includes Wernicke-Korsakoff dis-\\nease, alcoholic cerebellar degeneration, alcoholic\\nmyopathy, alcoholic neuropathy, alcohol withdrawal\\nsyndrome with seizures and delirium tremens, and fetal\\nalcohol syndrome.\\nDescription\\nAcute excess intake of alcohol can cause drunken-\\nness (intoxication) or even death, and chronic or long-\\nterm abuse leads to potentially irreversible damage to\\nvirtually any level of the nervous system.

Sudden changes in blood chemistry, especially\\nsodium, related to alcohol abuse may cause central pon-\\ntine myelinolysis, a condition of the brainstem in which\\nnerves lose their myelin coating. Liver disease compli-\\ncating alcoholic cirrhosis may cause dementia , deliri-\\num, and movement disorder.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nWhen a person drinks alcohol, it is absorbed by\\nblood vessels in the stomach lining and flows rapidly\\nthroughout the body and brain, as ethanol freely crosses\\nthe blood-brain barrier that ordinarily keeps large mole-\\ncules from escaping from the blood vessel to the brain\\ntissue. Drunkenness, or intoxication, may occur at blood\\nethanol concentrations of as low as 50-150 mg per dL in\\npeople who don’t drink. Sleepiness, stupor,coma,o r\\neven death from respiratory depression and low blood\\npressure occur at progressively higher concentrations.\\nAlthough alcohol is broken down by the liver, the\\ntoxic effects from a high dose of alcohol are most likely a\\ndirect result of alcohol itself rather than of its breakdown\\nproducts. The fatal dose varies widely because people\\nwho drink heavily develop a tolerance to the effects of\\nalcohol with repeated use. In addition, alcohol tolerance\\nresults in the need for higher levels of blood alcohol to\\nachieve intoxicating effects, which increases the likeli-\\nhood that habitual drinkers will be exposed to high and\\npotentially toxic levels of ethanol. This is particularly\\ntrue when binge drinkers fail to eat, because fasting\\ndecreases the rate of alcohol clearance and causes even\\nhigher blood alcohol levels.\\nWhen a chronic alcoholic suddenly stops drinking,\\nwithdrawal of alcohol leads to a syndrome of increased\\nexcitability of the central nervous system, called deliri-\\num tremens or “DTs.” Symptoms begin six to eight\\nhours after abstinence, and are most pronounced 24-72\\nhours after abstinence. They include body shaking\\n(tremulousness),insomnia , agitation, confusion, hear-\\ning voices or seeing images that are not really there\\n(such as crawling bugs), seizures, rapid heart beat, pro-\\nfuse sweating, high blood pressure, and fever. Alcohol-\\nrelated seizures may also occur without withdrawal,\\nsuch as during active heavy drinking or after more than a\\nweek without alcohol.\\nWernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is caused by defi-\\nciency of the B-vitamin thiamine, and can also be seen in\\npeople who don’t drink but have some other cause of thi-\\namine deficiency, such as chronic vomiting that prevents\\nthe absorption of this vitamin. Patients with this condi-\\ntion have the sudden onset of Wernicke encephalopathy;\\nthe symptoms include marked confusion, delirium, dis-\\norientation, inattention, memory loss, and drowsiness.\\nExamination reveals abnormalities of eye movement,\\nincluding jerking of the eyes (nystagmus ) and double\\nvision. Problems with balance make walking difficult.\\nPeople may have trouble coordinating their leg move-\\nments, but usually not their arms. If thiamine is not given\\npromptly, Wernicke encephalopathy may progress to stu-\\npor, coma, and death.\\nIf thiamine is given and death averted, Korsakoff’s\\nsyndrome may develop in some patients, who suffer\\nfrom memory impairment that leaves them unable to\\nremember events for a period of a few years before the\\nonset of illness (retrograde amnesia) and unable to learn\\nnew information (anterograde amnesia). Most patients\\nhave very limited insight into their memory dysfunction\\nand have a tendency to make up explanations for events\\nthey have forgotten (confabulation).\\nSevere alcoholism can cause cerebellar degenera-\\ntion, a slowly progressive condition affecting portions of\\nthe brain called the anterior and superior cerebellar ver-\\nmis, causing a wide-based gait, leg incoordination, and\\nan inability to walk heel-to-toe in tightrope fashion. The\\ngait disturbance usually develops over several weeks, but\\nmay be relatively mild for some time, and then suddenly\\nworsen after binge drinking or an unrelated illness.\\nFetal alcohol syndrome occurs in infants born to\\nalcoholic mothers when prenatal exposure to ethanol\\nretards fetal growth and development.

Symptoms include pain-\\nless weakness of the limb muscles closest to the trunk\\nand the girdle muscles, including the thighs, hips,\\nshoulders, and upper arms. This weakness develops\\ngradually, over weeks or months, without symptoms of\\nacute muscle injury. Muscle atrophy, or decreased bulk,\\nmay be striking. The nerves of the extremities may also\\nbegin to break down, a condition known as alcoholic\\nperipheral neuropathy, which can add to the person’s\\ndifficulty in moving.\\nThe way in which alcohol destroys muscle tissue is\\nstill not well understood. Proposed mechanisms include\\nmuscle membrane changes affecting the transport of cal-\\ncium, potassium, or other minerals ; impaired muscle\\nenergy metabolism; and impaired protein synthesis.\\nAlcohol is metabolized or broken down primarily by the\\nliver, with a series of chemical reactions in which ethanol\\nis converted to acetate. Acetate is metabolized by skeletal\\nmuscle, and alcohol-related changes in liver function\\nmay affect skeletal muscle metabolism, decreasing the\\namount of blood sugar available to muscles during pro-\\nlonged activity. Because not enough sugar is available to\\nsupply needed energy, muscle protein may be broken\\ndown as an alternate energy source. However, toxic\\neffects on muscle may be a direct result of alcohol itself\\nrather than of its breakdown products.\\nAlthough alcoholic peripheral neuropathy may con-\\ntribute to muscle weakness and atrophy by injuring the\\nmotor nerves controlling muscle movement, alcoholic\\nneuropathy more commonly affects sensory fibers.\\nInjury to these fibers can cause tingling or burning pain\\nin the feet, which may be severe enough to interfere with\\nwalking. As the condition worsens, pain decreases but\\nnumbness increases.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of alcohol-related neurologic disease\\ndepends largely on finding characteristic symptoms and\\nsigns in patients who abuse alcohol. Other possible\\ncauses should be excluded by the appropriate tests,\\nwhich may include blood chemistry,thyroid function\\ntests, brain MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) or CT\\n(computed tomography scan), and/or cerebrospinal\\nfluid analysis.\\nAcute alcoholic myopathy can be diagnosed by\\nfinding myoglobin in the urine and increased creatine\\nkinase and other blood enzymes released from injured\\nmuscle. The surgical removal of a small piece of muscle\\nfor microscopic analysis (muscle biopsy) shows the\\nscattered breakdown and repair of muscle fibers. Doc-\\ntors must rule out other acquired causes of muscle\\nbreakdown, which include the abuse of drugs such as\\nheroin,cocaine , or amphetamines; trauma with crush\\ninjury; the depletion of phosphate or potassium; or an\\nunderlying defect in the metabolism of carbohydrates or\\nlipids. In chronic alcoholic myopathy, serum creatine\\nkinase often is normal, and muscle biopsy shows atro-\\nphy, or loss of muscle fibers. Electromyography\\n(EMG) may show features characteristic of alcoholic\\nmyopathy or neuropathy.\\nTreatment\\nAcute management of alcohol intoxication, delirium\\ntremens, and withdrawal is primarily supportive, to mon-\\nitor and treat any cardiovascular or respiratory failure\\nthat may develop. In delirium tremens, fever and sweat-\\ning may necessitate treatment of fluid loss and secondary\\nlow blood pressure. Agitation may be treated with ben-\\nzodiazepines such as chlordiazepoxide, beta-adrenergic\\nantagonists such as atenolol, or alpha 2-adrenergic ago-\\nnists such as clonidine. Because Wernicke’s syndrome is\\nrapidly reversible with thiamine, and because death may\\nintervene if thiamine is not given promptly, all patients\\nadmitted for acute complications of alcohol, as well as\\nall patients with unexplained encephalopathy, should be\\ngiven intravenous thiamine.\\nWithdrawal seizures typically resolve without spe-\\ncific anti-epileptic drug treatment, although status epilep-\\nticus (continual seizures occurring without interruption)\\nshould be treated vigorously.

Alco-\\nholism is the popular term for two disorders, alcohol\\nabuse and alcohol dependence. The hallmarks of both\\nthese disorders involve repeated life problems that can be\\ndirectly attributed to the use of alcohol. Both these disor-\\nders can have serious consequences, affecting an individ-\\nual’s health and personal life, as well as having an impact\\non society at large.\\nDescription\\nThe effects of alcoholism are quite far-reaching.\\nAlcohol affects every body system, causing a wide range\\nof health problems. Some such problems include poor\\nnutrition, memory disorders, difficulty with balance and\\nwalking, liver disease (including cirrhosis and hepatitis),\\nhigh blood pressure, muscle weakness (including the\\nheart), heart rhythm disturbances, anemia, clotting disor-\\nders, decreased immunity to infections, gastrointestinal\\ninflammation and irritation, acute and chronic problems\\nwith the pancreas, low blood sugar, high blood fat con-\\ntent, interference with reproductive fertility, and weak-\\nened bones.\\nOn a personal level, alcoholism results in marital\\nand other relationship difficulties, depression, unemploy-\\nment,child abuse, and general family dysfunction.\\nAlcoholism causes or contributes to a variety of\\nsevere social problems including homelessness, murder,\\nsuicide, injury, and violent crime. Alcohol is a contribut-\\ning factor in at least 50% of all deaths from motor vehi-\\ncle accidents. In fact, about 100,000 deaths occur each\\nyear due to the effects of alcohol, of which 50% are due\\nto injuries of some sort. According to a recent special\\nreport prepared for the U.S. Congress by the National\\nInstitute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, the impact\\nof alcohol on society, including violence, traffic acci-\\ndents, lost work productivity, and premature death, costs\\nour nation an estimated $185 billion annually. In addi-\\ntion, it is estimated that approximately one in four chil-\\ndren (19 million children or 29 percent of children up to\\n17 years of age) is exposed at some time to familial alco-\\nhol abuse, alcohol dependence, or both. Furthermore, it\\nhas been estimated that approximately 18 percent of\\nadults experience an episode of alcohol abuse or depen-\\ndence a some time during their lives.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThere are probably a number of factors that work\\ntogether to cause a person to become an alcoholic.\\nRecent genetic studies have demonstrated that close rel-\\natives of an alcoholic are four times more likely to\\nbecome alcoholics themselves. Furthermore, this risk\\nholds true even for children who were adopted away\\nfrom their biological families at birth and raised in a\\nnon-alcoholic adoptive family, with no knowledge of\\ntheir biological family’s difficulties with alcohol. More\\nresearch is being conducted to determine if genetic fac-\\ntors could account for differences in alcohol metabo-\\nlism that may increase the risk of an individual becom-\\ning an alcoholic.\\nThe symptoms of alcoholism can be broken down\\ninto two major categories: symptoms of acute alcohol\\nuse and symptoms of long-term alcohol use.\\nImmediate (acute) effects of alcohol use\\nAlcohol exerts a depressive effect on the brain. The\\nblood-brain barrier does not prevent alcohol from enter-\\ning the brain, so the brain alcohol level will quickly\\nbecome equivalent to the blood alcohol level. Alcohol’s\\ndepressive effects result in difficulty walking, poor bal-\\nance, slurring of speech, and generally poor coordination\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 95\\nAlcoholism\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 95'),\n",

The affected person may also have impairment of\\nperiperal vision. At higher alcohol levels, a person’s\\nbreathing and heart rates will be slowed, and vomiting\\nmay occur (with a high risk of the vomit being breathed\\ninto the lungs, resulting in severe problems, including the\\npossibility of pneumonia ). Still higher alcohol levels\\nmay result in coma and death.\\nEffects of long-term (chronic) alcoholism\\nLong-term use of alcohol affects virtually every\\norgan system of the body:\\n• Nervous system. An estimated 30-40% of all men in\\ntheir teens and twenties have experienced alcoholic\\nblackout, which occurs when drinking a large quantity\\nof alcohol results in the loss of memory of the time\\nsurrounding the episode of drinking. Alcohol is well-\\nknown to cause sleep disturbances, so that overall\\nsleep quality is affected. Numbness and tingling may\\noccur in the arms and legs. Two syndromes, which can\\noccur together or separately, are known as Wernicke’s\\nand Korsakoff’s syndromes. Both are due to the low\\nthiamine (a form of vitamin B complex) levels found\\nin alcoholics. Wernicke’s syndrome results in disor-\\ndered eye movements, very poor balance and difficulty\\nwalking, while Korsakoff’s syndrome severely\\naffects one’s memory, preventing new learning from\\ntaking place.\\n• Gastrointestinal system. Alcohol causes loosening of\\nthe muscular ring that prevents the stomach’s contents\\nfrom re-entering the esophagus. Therefore, the acid\\nfrom the stomach flows backwards into the esopha-\\ngus, burning those tissues, and causing pain and\\nbleeding. Inflammation of the stomach can also result\\nin bleeding and pain, and decreased desire to eat. A\\nmajor cause of severe, uncontrollable bleeding (hem-\\norrhage) in an alcoholic is the development of\\nenlarged (dilated) blood vessels within the esophagus,\\nwhich are called esophageal varices. These varices are\\nactually developed in response to liver disease, and\\nare extremely prone to bursting and hemorrhaging.\\nDiarrheais a common symptom, due to alcohol’s\\neffect on the pancreas. In addition, inflammation of\\nthe pancreas (pancreatitis ) is a serious and painful\\nproblem in alcoholics. Throughout the intestinal tract,\\nalcohol interferes with the absorption of nutrients,\\ncreating a malnourished state. Because alcohol is bro-\\nken down (metabolized) within the liver, that organ is\\nseverely affected by constant levels of alcohol. Alco-\\nhol interferes with a number of important chemical\\nprocesses that also occur in the liver. The liver begins\\nto enlarge and fill with fat (fatty liver ), fibrous scar\\ntissue interferes with the liver’s normal structure and\\nfunction (cirrhosis), and the liver may become\\ninflamed (hepatitis).\\n• Blood. Alcohol can cause changes to all the types of\\nblood cells. Red blood cells become abnormally\\nlarge. White blood cells (important for fighting infec-\\ntions) decrease in number, resulting in a weakened\\nimmune system. This places alcoholics at increased\\nrisk for infections, and is thought to account in part\\nfor the increased risk of cancer faced by alcoholics\\n(ten times increased over normal). Platelets and blood\\nclotting factors are affected, causing an increased risk\\nof bleeding.\\n• Heart. Small amounts of alcohol cause a drop in blood\\npressure, but with increased use, alcohol begins to\\nincrease blood pressure into a dangerous range. High\\nlevels of fats circulating in the bloodstream increase the\\nrisk of heart disease. Heavy drinking results in an\\nincrease in heart size, weakening of the heart muscle,\\nabnormal heart rhythms, a risk of blood clots forming\\nwithin the chambers of the heart, and a greatly\\nincreased risk of stroke (due to a blood clot from the\\nheart entering the circulatory system, going to the\\nbrain, and blocking a brain blood vessel).\\n• Reproductive system. Heavy drinking has a negative\\neffect on fertility in both men and women, by decreas-\\ning testicle and ovary size, and interfering with both\\nsperm and egg production. When pregnancy is\\nachieved in an alcoholic woman, the baby has a great\\nrisk of being born with fetal alcohol syndrome, which\\ncauses distinctive facial defects, lowered IQ, and\\nbehavioral problems.\\nDiagnosis\\nTwo different types of alcohol-related difficulties\\nhave been identified. The first is called alcohol depen-\\ndence, which refers to a person who literally depends on\\nthe use of alcohol. Three of the following traits must be\\npresent to diagnose alcohol dependence:\\n• tolerance, meaning that a person becomes accustomed\\nto a particular dose of alcohol, and must increase the\\ndose in order to obtain the desired effect\\n• withdrawal, meaning that a person experiences\\nunpleasant physical and psychological symptoms when\\nhe or she does not drink alcohol\\n• the tendency to drink more alcohol than one intends\\n(once an alcoholic starts to drink, he or she finds it dif-\\nficult to stop)\\n• being unable to avoid drinking or stop drinking once\\nstarted\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 296\\nAlcoholism\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 96'),\n",

Because of drinking, a person repeatedly:\\n• fails to live up to his or her most important responsibili-\\nties\\n• physically endangers him or herself, or others (for\\nexample, by drinking when driving)\\n• gets into trouble with the law\\n• experiences difficulties in relationships or jobs\\nDiagnosis is sometimes brought about when family\\nmembers call an alcoholic’s difficulties to the attention\\nof a physician. A clinician may begin to be suspicious\\nwhen a patient suffers repeated injuries or begins to\\nexperience medical problems related to the use of alco-\\nhol. In fact, some estimates suggest that about 20% of a\\nphysician’s patients will be alcoholics.\\nDiagnosis is aided by administering specific psycho-\\nlogical assessments that try to determine what aspects of\\na person’s life may be affected by his or her use of alco-\\nhol. Determining the exact quantity of alcohol that a per-\\nson drinks is of much less importance than determining\\nhow his or her drinking affects relationships, jobs, educa-\\ntional goals, and family life. In fact, because the metabo-\\nlism of alcohol (how the body breaks down and process-\\nes alcohol) is so individual, the quantity of alcohol con-\\nsumed is not part of the criteria list for diagnosing either\\nalcohol dependence or alcohol abuse.\\nOne very simple tool for beginning the diagnosis of\\nalcoholism is called the CAGE questionnaire. It consists\\nof four questions, with the first letters of each key word\\nspelling out the word CAGE:\\n• Have you ever tried to Cut down on your drinking?\\n• Have you ever been Annoyed by anyone’s comments\\nabout your drinking?\\n• Have you ever felt Guilty about your drinking?\\n• Do you ever need an Eye-opener (a morning drink of\\nalcohol) to start the day)?\\nOther, longer lists of questions exist to help deter-\\nmine the severity and effects of a person’s alcohol use.\\nGiven the recent research pointing to a genetic basis\\nfor alcoholism, it is important to ascertain whether\\nanyone else in the person’s family has ever suffered\\nfrom alcoholism.\\nPhysical examination may reveal signs suggestive\\nof alcoholism: evidence of old injuries; a visible network\\nof enlarged veins just under the skin around the navel\\n(called caput medusae); fluid in the abdomen (ascites);\\nyellowish-tone to the skin; decreased testicular size in\\nmen; and poor nutritional status. Lab work may reveal an\\nincrease in the size of the red blood cells; abnormalities\\nin the white blood cells (cells responsible for fighting\\ninfection) and platelets (particles responsible for clot-\\nting); and an increase in certain liver enzymes.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of alcoholism has two parts. The first step\\nin the treatment of alcoholism, called detoxification,\\ninvolves helping the person stop drinking and ridding his\\nor her body of the harmful (toxic) effects of alcohol.\\nBecause the person’s body has become accustomed to\\nalcohol, the person will need to be supported through\\nwithdrawal. Withdrawal will be different for different\\npatients, depending on the severity of the alcoholism, as\\nmeasured by the quantity of alcohol ingested daily and the\\nlength of time the patient has been an alcoholic. With-\\ndrawal symptoms can range from mild to life-threatening.\\nMild withdrawal symptoms include nausea, achiness, diar-\\nrhea, difficulty sleeping, sweatiness,anxiety, and trem-\\nbling. This phase is usually over in about three to five\\ndays. More severe effects of withdrawal can include hallu-\\ncinations (in which a patient sees, hears, or feels some-\\nthing that is not actually real), seizures, an unbearable\\ncraving for more alcohol, confusion,fever, fast heart rate,\\nhigh blood pressure, and delirium (a fluctuating level of\\nconsciousness).

No medications are necessary,\\nhowever. Treatment of a patient suffering the more severe\\neffects of withdrawal may require the use of sedative med-\\nications to relieve the discomfort of withdrawal and to\\navoid the potentially life-threatening complications of high\\nblood pressure, fast heart rate, and seizures. Drugs called\\nbenzodiazapines are helpful in those patients suffering\\nfrom hallucinations. Because of the patient’s nausea, fluids\\nmay need to be given through a vein (intravenously), along\\nwith some necessary sugars and salts. It is crucial that thi-\\namine be included in the fluids, because thiamine is usually\\nquite low in alcoholic patients, and deficiency of thiamine\\nis responsible for the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.\\nAfter cessation of drinking has been accomplished,\\nthe next steps involve helping the patient avoid ever tak-\\ning another drink. This phase of treatment is referred to\\nas rehabilitation . The best programs incorporate the\\nfamily into the therapy, because the family has undoubt-\\nedly been severely affected by the patient’s drinking.\\nSome therapists believe that family members, in an effort\\nto deal with their loved one’s drinking problem, some-\\ntimes develop patterns of behavior that accidentally sup-\\nport or “enable” the patient’s drinking. This situation is\\nreferred to as “co-dependence,” and must be addressed in\\norder to successfully treat a person’s alcoholism.\\nSessions led by peers, where recovering alcoholics\\nmeet regularly and provide support for each other’s\\nrecoveries, are considered some of the best methods of\\npreventing a return to drinking (relapse). Perhaps the\\nmost well-known such group is called Alcoholics\\nAnonymous, which uses a “12-step” model to help peo-\\nple avoid drinking. These steps involve recognizing the\\ndestructive power that alcohol has held over the alco-\\nholic’s life, looking to a higher power for help in over-\\ncoming the problem, and reflecting on the ways in\\nwhich the use of alcohol has hurt others and, if possi-\\nble, making amends to those people. According to a\\nrecent study reported by the American Psychological\\nAssociation (APA), anyone, regardless of his or her\\nreligious beliefs or lack of religious beliefs, can benefit\\nfrom participation in 12-step programs such as Alco-\\nholics Anonymous (AA) or Narcotics Anonymous\\n(NA). The number of visits to 12-step self-help groups\\nexceeds the number of visits to all mental health profes-\\nsionals combined.\\nThere are also medications that may help an alco-\\nholic avoid returning to drinking. These have been used\\nwith variable success. Disulfiram (Antabuse) is a drug\\nwhich, when mixed with alcohol, causes unpleasant reac-\\ntions including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and trembling.\\nNaltrexone, along with a similar compound, Nalmefene,\\ncan be helpful in limiting the effects of a relapse. Acam-\\nprosate is helpful in preventing relapse. None of these\\nmedications would be helpful unless the patient was also\\nwilling to work very hard to change his or her behavior.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative treatments can be a helpful adjunct for the\\nalcoholic patient, once the medical danger of withdrawal\\nhas passed. Because many alcoholics have very stressful\\nlives (whether because of or leading to the alcoholism is\\nsometimes a matter of debate), many of the treatments for\\nalcoholism involve dealing with and relieving stress. These\\ninclude massage, meditation, and hypnotherapy. The\\nmalnutrition of long-term alcohol use is addressed by nutri-\\ntion-oriented practitioners with careful attention to a\\nhealthy diet and the use of nutritional supplements such as\\nvitaminsA, B complex, and C, as well as certain fatty\\nacids, amino acids, zinc, magnesium, and selenium. Herbal\\ntreatments include milk thistle(Silybum marianum), which\\nis thought to protect the liver against damage. Other herbs\\nare thought to be helpful for the patient suffering through\\nwithdrawal. Some of these include lavender (Lavandula\\nofficinalis), skullcap (Scutellaria lateriflora), chamomile\\n(Matricaria recutita ), peppermint ( Mentha piperita )\\nyarrow ( Achillea millefolium ), and valerian ( Valeriana\\nofficinalis). Acupuncture is believed to both decrease\\nwithdrawal symptoms and to help improve a patient’s\\nchances for continued recovery from alcoholism.\\nPrognosis\\nRecovery from alcoholism is a life-long process. In\\nfact, people who have suffered from alcoholism are encour-\\naged to refer to themselves ever after as “a recovering alco-\\nholic,” never a recovered alcoholic. This is because most\\nresearchers in the field believe that since the potential for\\nalcoholism is still part of the individual’s biological and\\npsychological makeup, one can never fully recover from\\nalcoholism. The potential for relapse (returning to illness)\\nis always there, and must be acknowledged and respected.\\nStatistics suggest that, among middle-class alcoholics in\\nstable financial and family situations who have undergone\\ntreatment, 60% or more can be successful at an attempt to\\nstop drinking for at least a year, and many for a lifetime.\\nPrevention\\nPrevention must begin at a relatively young age\\nsince the first instance of intoxication (drunkenness) usu-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 298\\nAlcoholism\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 98'),\n",

Like all enzymes, it is needed to\\ntrigger specific chemical reactions. Aldolase helps mus-\\ncle turn sugar into energy. Testing for aldolase is done to\\ndiagnose and monitor skeletal muscle diseases.\\nPurpose\\nSkeletal muscle diseases increase the aldolase level\\nfound in a person’s blood. Skeletal muscles are those\\nmuscles attached to bones and whose contractions make\\nthose bones move. When the muscles are diseased or\\ndamaged, such as in muscular dystrophy, the cells dete-\\nriorate and break open. The contents of the cells, includ-\\ning aldolase, spill into the bloodstream. Measuring the\\namount of aldolase in the blood indicates the degree of\\nmuscle damage.\\nAs muscles continue to deteriorate, aldolase levels\\ndecrease and eventually fall below normal. Less muscle\\nmeans fewer cells and less aldolase.\\nMuscle weakness may be caused by neurologic as\\nwell as muscular problems. The measurement of aldolase\\nlevels can help pinpoint the cause. Aldolase levels will be\\nnormal where muscle weakness is caused by neurologi-\\ncal disease, such as poliomyelitis or multiple sclerosis ,\\nbut aldolase levels will be elevated in cases of muscular\\ndisease, such as muscular dystrophy.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 99\\nAlcoholism\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 99'),\n",

Primary aldosteronism is most commonly caused\\nby an adrenal tumor, as in Conn’s syndrome. Idiopathic\\n(of unknown cause) hyperaldosteronism is another type\\nof primary aldosteronism. Secondary aldosteronism is\\nmore common and may occur with congestive heart fail-\\nure, cirrhosis with fluid in the abdominal cavity\\n(ascites ), certain kidney diseases, excess potassium,\\nsodium-depleted diet, and toxemia of pregnancy.\\nTo differentiate primary aldosteronism from sec-\\nondary aldosteronism, a plasma renin test should be per-\\nformed at the same time as the aldosterone assay. Renin,\\nan enzyme produced in the kidneys, is high in secondary\\naldosteronism and low in primary aldosteronism.\\nDescription\\nAldosterone testing can be performed on a blood\\nsample or on a 24-hour urine specimen. Several factors,\\nincluding diet, posture (upright or lying down), and time\\nof day that the sample is obtained can cause aldosterone\\nlevels to fluctuate. Blood samples are affected by short-\\nterm fluctuations. A urine specimen collected over an\\nentire 24-hour period lessens the effects of those inter-\\nfering factors and provides a more reliable aldosterone\\nmeasurement.\\nPreparation\\nFasting is not required for either the blood sample\\nor urine collection, but the patient should maintain a nor-\\nmal sodium diet (approximately 0.1 oz [3 g] /day) for at\\nleast two weeks before either test. The doctor should\\ndecide if drugs that alter sodium, potassium, and fluid\\nbalance (e.g.,diuretics, antihypertensives, steroids, oral\\ncontraceptives ) should be withheld.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 115}, page_content='Alemtuzumab\\nDefinition\\nAlemtuzumab is sold as Campath in the United\\nStates. Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal anti-\\nbody that selectively binds to CD52, a protein found on\\nthe surface of normal and malignant B and T cells, that is\\nused to reduce the numbers of circulating malignant cells\\nof patients who have B-cell chronic lymphocytic\\nleukemia (B-CLL).\\nPurpose\\nAlemtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody used to treat\\nB-CLL, one of the most prevalent forms of adult chronic\\nleukemia. It specifically binds CD52, a protein found on\\nthe surface of essentially all B and T cells of the immune\\nsystem. By binding the CD52 protein on the malignant B\\ncells, the antibody targets it for removal from the circula-\\ntion. Scientists believe that alemtuzumab triggers anti-\\nbody-mediated lysis of the B cells, a method that the\\nimmune system uses to eliminate foreign cells.\\nAlemtuzumab has been approved by the FDA for\\ntreatment of refractory B-CLL. For a patient’s disease to\\nbe classified as refractory, both alkylating agents and flu-\\ndarabine treatment must have been tried and failed. Thus,\\nthis drug gives patients who have tried all approved treat-\\nments for B-CLL another option. As most patients with\\nB-CLL are in stage III or IV by the time both alkylating\\nagents and fludarabine have been tried, the experience\\nwith alemtuzumab treatment are primarily with those\\nstages of the disease. In clinical trials, about 30% of\\npatients had a partial response to the drug, with 2% of\\nthese being complete responses.\\nThis antibody has been tested with limited success\\nin the treatment of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) and\\nfor the preparation of patients with various immune cell\\nmalignancies for bone marrow transplantation. There is\\nalso a clinical trial ongoing to test the ability of this anti-\\nbody to prevent rejection in kidney transplantation.\\nDescription\\nAlemtuzumab is produced in the laboratory using\\ngenetically engineered single clones of B-cells. Like all\\nantibodies, it is a Y-shaped molecule can bind one partic-\\nular substance, the antigen for that monoclonal antibody.\\nFor alemtuzumab, the antigen is CD52, a protein found\\non the surface of normal and malignant B and T cells as\\nwell as other cells of the immune and male reproductive\\nsystems. Alemtuzumab is a humanized antibody, mean-\\ning that the regions that bind CD52, located on the tips of\\nthe Y branches, are derived from rat antibodies, but the\\nrest of the antibody is human sequence. The presence of\\nthe human sequences helps to reduce the immune\\nresponse by the patient against the antibody itself, a\\nproblem seen when complete mouse antibodies are used\\nfor cancer therapies. The human sequences also help to\\nensure that the various cell-destroying mechanisms of\\nthe human immune system are properly triggered with\\nbinding of the antibody.\\nAlemtuzumab was approved in May of 2001 for the\\ntreatment of refractory B-CLL. It is approved for use\\nalone but clinical trials have tested the ability of the anti-\\nbody to be used in combination with the purine analogs\\npentostatin, fludarabine, and cladribine, and rituximab, a\\nmonoclonal antibody specific for the CD20 antigen,\\nanother protein found on the surface of B cells.\\nRecommended dosage\\nThis antibody should be administered in a gradually\\nescalating pattern at the start of treatment and any time\\nadministration is interrupted for seven or more days. The\\nrecommended beginning dosage for B-CLL patients is a\\ndaily dose of 3 mg of Campath administered as a two-\\nhour IV infusion. Once this amount is tolerated, the dose\\nis increased to 10 mg per day. After tolerating this dose,\\nit can be increased to 30 mg, administered three days a\\nweek. Acetominophen and diphenhydramine hydro-\\nchoride are given thirty to sixty minutes before the infu-\\nsion to help reduce side effects.\\nAdditionally, patients generally receive anti-infec-\\ntive medication before treatment to help minimize the\\nserious opportunistic infections that can result from this\\ntreatment. Specifically, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole\\n(to prevent bacterial infections) and famciclovir (to pre-\\nvent viral infections) were used during the clinical trial to\\ndecrease infections, although they were not eliminated.\\nPrecautions\\nBlood studies should be done on a weekly basis\\nwhile patients are receiving the alemtuzumab treat-\\nment. Vaccination during the treatment session is not\\nrecommended, given the T cell depletion that occurs\\nduring treatment. Furthermore, given that antibodies\\nlike alumtuzumab can pass through the placenta to the\\ndeveloping fetus and in breast milk, use during preg-\\nnancy and breastfeeding is not recommended unless\\nclearly needed.\\nSide effects\\nA severe side effect of alemtuzumab treatment is the\\npossible depletion of one or more types of blood cells.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2102\\nAlemtuzumab\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 102'),\n",

He became an actor and Shake-\\nspearean reciter, and early in his career he began to suffer\\nfrom strain on his vocal chords. He sought medical atten-\\ntion for chronic hoarseness, but after treatment with a\\nrecommended prescription and extensive periods of rest,\\nhis problem persisted.\\nAlexander realized that his hoarseness began about\\nan hour into a dramatic performance and reasoned that it\\nwas something he did in the process of reciting that\\ncaused him to lose his voice. Returning to his medical\\ndoctor, Alexander told him of his observation. When the\\ndoctor admitted that he didn’t know what Alexander was\\ndoing to injure his vocal chords, Alexander decided to try\\nand find out for himself.\\nThus began a decade of self-observation and discov-\\nery. Using as many as three mirrors to observe himself in\\nthe act of reciting, normal speaking, and later standing,\\nwalking, and sitting, Alexander managed to improve his\\ncoordination and to overcome his vocal problems. One of\\nhis most startling discoveries was that in order to change\\nthe way he used his body he had to change the way he\\nwas thinking, redirecting his thoughts in such a way that\\nhe did not produce unnecessary tension when he attempt-\\ned speech or movement. After making this discovery at\\nthe end of the nineteenth century, Alexander became a\\npioneer in body-mind medicine.\\nAt first, performers and dancers sought guidance\\nfrom Alexander to overcome physical complaints and\\nto improve the expression and spontaneity of their\\nperformances. Soon a great number of people sought\\nhelp from his teaching for a variety of physical and\\nmental disorders.\\nThe Alexander technique is primarily taught one-\\non-one in private lessons. Introductory workshops or\\nworkshops for special applications of the technique\\n(e.g.,workshops for musicians) are also common. Pri-\\nvate lessons range from a half-hour to an hour in length,\\nand are taught in a series. The number of lessons varies\\naccording to the severity of the student’s difficulties\\nwith coordination or to the extent of the student’s inter-\\nest in pursuing the improvements made possible by con-\\ntinued study. The cost of lessons ranges from $40-80 per\\nhour. Insurance coverage is not widely available, but\\ndiscounts are available for participants in some comple-\\nmentary care insurance plans. Pre-tax Flexible Spending\\nAccounts for health care cover Alexander technique\\nlessons if they are prescribed by a physician.\\nIn lessons teachers guide students through simple\\nmovements (while students are dressed in comfortable\\nclothing) and use their hands to help students identify\\nand stop destructive patterns of tension. Tensing arises\\nfrom mental processes as well as physical, so discussions\\nof personal reactions or behavior are likely to arise in the\\ncourse of a lesson.\\nThe technique helps students move with ease and\\nimproved coordination. At the beginning of a move-\\nment (the lessons are a series of movements), most\\npeople pull back their heads, raise their shoulders\\ntoward their ears, over-arch their lower backs, tighten\\ntheir legs, and otherwise produce excessive tension in\\ntheir bodies. Alexander referred to this as misuse of\\nthe body.\\nAt any point in a movement, proper use can be\\nestablished. If the neck muscles are not over-tensed, the\\nhead will carry slightly forward of the spine, simply\\nbecause it is heavier in the front. When the head is out of\\nbalance in the forward direction, it sets off a series of\\nstretch reflexes in the extensor muscles of the back. It is\\nskillful use of these reflexes, along with reflex activity in\\nthe feet and legs, the arms and hands, the breathing\\nmechanism, and other parts of the body, that lessons in\\nthe technique aim to develop.\\nAlexander found that optimal functioning of the\\nbody was very hard to maintain, even for the short period\\nof time it took to complete a single movement. People,\\nespecially adults, have very strong tension habits associ-\\nated with movement. Chronic misuse of the muscles is\\ncommon. It may be caused by slouching in front of tele-\\nvisions or video monitors, too much sitting or driving\\nand too little walking, or by tension associated with past\\ntraumas and injuries. Stiffening the neck after a\\nwhiplashinjury or favoring a broken or sprained leg\\nlong after it has healed are examples of habitual tension\\ncaused by injury.\\nThe first thing a teacher of the Alexander tech-\\nnique does is to increase a student’s sensory awareness\\nof this excessive habitual tension, particularly that in\\nthe neck and spine. Next the student is taught to inhibit\\nthe tension. If the student prepares to sit down, for\\nexample, he will tense his muscles in his habitual way.\\nIf he is asked to put aside the intention to sit and\\ninstead to free his neck and allow less constriction in\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2104\\nAlexander technique\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 104'),\n",

In Alexander lessons stu-\\ndents learn to direct themselves this way in activity and\\nbecome skilled in fluid, coordinated movement.\\nPrecautions\\nSide effects\\nThe focus of the Alexander technique is educational.\\nTeachers use their hands simply to gently guide students\\nin movement. Therefore, both contraindications and\\npotential physiological side effects are kept to a mini-\\nmum. No forceful treatment of soft tissue or bony struc-\\nture is attempted, so damage to tissues, even in the case\\nof errors in teaching, is unlikely.\\nAs students’ sensory awareness develops in the\\ncourse of Alexander lessons, they become more acutely\\naware of chronic tension patterns. As students learn to\\nrelease excessive tension in their muscles and to sustain\\nthis release in daily activity, they may experience tight-\\nness or soreness in the connective tissue. This is caused\\nby the connective tissue adapting to the lengthened and\\nreleased muscles and the expanded range of movement\\nin the joints.\\nOccasionally students may get light-headed during a\\nlesson as contracted muscles release and effect the circu-\\nlatory or respiratory functioning.\\nForceful contraction of muscles and rigid postures\\noften indicate suppression of emotion.

Like all enzymes, it is needed, in small\\namounts, to trigger specific chemical reactions. When it\\nis present in large amounts, it may signify bone or liver\\ndisease or a tumor.\\nPurpose\\nMedical testing of alkaline phosphatase is concerned\\nwith the enzyme that is found in liver, bone, placenta,\\nand intestine. In a healthy liver, fluid containing alkaline\\nphosphate and other substances is continually drained\\naway through the bile duct. In a diseased liver, this bile\\nduct is often blocked, keeping fluid within the liver.\\nAlkaline phosphatase accumulates and eventually\\nescapes into the bloodstream.\\nThe alkaline phosphatase of the liver is produced by\\nthe cells lining the small bile ducts (ductoles) in the liver.\\nIts origin differs from that of other enzymes called\\naminotransferases. If the liver disease is primarily of an\\nobstructive nature (cholestatic), i.e. involving the biliary\\ndrainage system, the alkaline phosphatase will be the\\nfirst and foremost enzyme elevation. If, on the other\\nhand, the disease is primarily of the liver cells (hepato-\\ncytes), the aminotransferases will rise prominently.Thus,\\nthese enzymes are very useful in distinguishing the type\\nof liver disease—cholestatic or hepatocellular.\\nGrowing bones need alkaline phosphatase. Any con-\\ndition of bone growth will cause alkaline phosphatase\\nlevels to rise. The condition may be normal, such as a\\nchildhood growth spurt or the healing of a broken bone;\\nor the condition may be a disease, such as bone cancer,\\nPaget’s disease, or rickets.\\nDuring pregnancy, alkaline phosphatase is made by\\nthe placenta and leaks into the mother’s bloodstream.\\nThis is normal. Some tumors, however, start production\\nof the same kind of alkaline phosphatase produced by the\\nplacenta.

ABPA is a hypersensitivity reaction\\nthat occurs in asthma patients who are allergic to this\\nspecific fungus.\\nDescription\\nABPA is an allergic reaction to a species of\\nAspergillus called Aspergillus fumigatus. It is sometimes\\ngrouped together with other lung disorders characterized\\nby eosinophilia—an abnormal increase of a certain type\\nof white blood cell in the blood—under the heading of\\neosinophilic pneumonia. These disorders are also called\\nhypersensitivity lung diseases.\\nABPA appears to be increasing in frequency in the\\nUnited States, although the reasons for the increase are not\\nclear. The disorder is most likely to occur in adult asthmat-\\nics aged 20-40. It affects males and females equally.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nABPA develops when the patient breathes air con-\\ntaining Aspergillus spores. These spores are found\\nworldwide, especially around riverbanks, marshes, bogs,\\nforests, and wherever there is wet or decaying vegetation.\\nThey are also found on wet paint, construction materials,\\nand in air conditioning systems. ABPA is a nosocomial\\ninfection, which means that a patient can get it in a hos-\\npital. When Aspergillus spores reach the bronchi, which\\nare the branches of the windpipe that lead into the lungs,\\nthe bronchi react by contracting spasmodically. So the\\npatient has difficulty breathing and usually wheezes or\\ncoughs. Many patients with ABPA also run a low-grade\\nfeverand lose their appetites.\\nComplications\\nPatients with ABPA sometimes cough up large\\namounts of blood, a condition that is called hemoptysis.\\nThey may also develop a serious long-term form of\\nbronchiectasis, the formation of fibrous tissue in the\\nlungs. Bronchiectasis is a chronic bronchial disorder\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 107\\nAllergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 107'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 121}, page_content='caused by repeated inflammation of the airway, and\\nmarked by the abnormal enlargement of, or damage to,\\nthe bronchial walls. ABPA sometimes occurs as a com-\\nplication of cystic fibrosis.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of ABPA is based on a combination of\\nthe patient’s history and the results of blood tests, sputum\\ntests, skin tests, and diagnostic imaging. The doctor will\\nbe concerned to distinguish between ABPA and a wors-\\nening of the patient’s asthma, cystic fibrosis, or other\\nlung disorders. There are seven major criteria for a diag-\\nnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis:\\n• a history of asthma.\\n• an accumulation of fluid in the lung that is visible on a\\nchest x ray.\\n• bronchiectasis (abnormal stretching, enlarging, or\\ndestruction of the walls of the bronchial tubes).\\n• skin reaction to Aspergillus antigen.\\n• eosinophilia in the patient’s blood and sputum.\\n•Aspergillus precipitins in the patient’s blood. Precip-\\nitins are antibodies that react with the antigen to form a\\nsolid that separates from the rest of the solution in the\\ntest tube.\\n• a high level of IgE in the patient’s blood. IgE refers to a\\nclass of antibodies in blood plasma that activate allergic\\nreactions to foreign particles.\\nOther criteria that may be used to support the diag-\\nnosis include the presence of Aspergillus in samples of\\nthe patient’s sputum, the coughing up of plugs of brown\\nmucus, or a late skin reaction to the Aspergillus antigen.\\nLaboratory tests\\nThe laboratory tests that are done to obtain this\\ninformation include a complete blood count (CBC), a\\nsputum culture , a blood serum test of IgE levels, and\\na skin test for the Aspergillus antigen. In the skin test, a\\nsmall amount of antigen is injected into the upper layer\\nof skin on the patient’s forearm about four inches\\nbelow the elbow. If the patient has a high level of IgE\\nantibodies in the tissue, he or she will develop what is\\ncalled a “wheal and flare” reaction in about 15-20 min-\\nutes. A “wheal and flare” reaction is characterized by\\nthe eruption of a reddened,itching spot on the skin.\\nSome patients with ABPA will develop the so-called\\nlate reaction to the skin test, in which a red, sore,\\nswollen area develops about six to eight hours after the\\ninitial reaction.\\nAspergillus can sometimes be seen under a micro-\\nscope slide made from the patient’s sputum, but the diag-\\nnosis is considered definite only when the fungus is cul-\\ntured in the laboratory. Aspergillus is easy to culture, and\\ncan be identified when it is stained with periodic acid-\\nSchiff (PAS), Calcofluor, or potassium hydroxide (KOH)\\npreparations.\\nDiagnostic imaging\\nChest x rays and CT scans are used to check for the\\npresence of fluid accumulation in the lungs and signs of\\nbronchiectasis.\\nTreatment\\nABPA is usually treated with prednisone (Meti-\\ncorten) or other corticosteroids taken by mouth, and\\nwith bronchodilators.\\nAntifungal drugs are not used to treat ABPA because\\nit is caused by an allergic reaction to Aspergillus rather\\nthan by direct infection of tissue.\\nFollow-up care\\nPatients with ABPA should be given periodic\\ncheckups with chest x rays and a spirometer test. A\\nspirometer is an instrument that evaluates the patient’s\\nlung capacity.\\nPrognosis\\nMost patients with ABPA respond well to corticos-\\nteroid treatment. Others have a chronic course with grad-\\nual improvement over time. The best indicator of a good\\nprognosis is a long-term fall in the patient’s IgE level.\\nPatients with lung complications from ABPA may devel-\\nop severe airway obstruction.\\nPrevention\\nABPA is difficult to prevent because Aspergillus is a\\ncommon fungus; it can be found in the saliva and sputum\\nof most healthy individuals. Patients with ABPA can pro-\\ntect themselves somewhat by avoiding haystacks, com-\\npost piles, bogs, marshes, and other locations with wet or\\nrotting vegetation; by avoiding construction sites or\\nnewly painted surfaces; and by having their air condi-\\ntioners cleaned regularly.

The skin is\\nthe most obvious site of reaction, but the joints, gastroin-\\ntestinal tract, and kidneys are also often affected.\\nAP affects approximately 35,000 people in the Unit-\\ned States each year. Most cases are children between the\\nages of two and seven. Boys are affected more often than\\ngirls, and most cases occur from late fall to winter.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nAP is caused by a reaction involving antibodies, spe-\\ncial proteins of the immune system. Antibodies are\\ndesigned to bind with foreign proteins, called antigens.\\nIn some situations, antigen-antibody complexes can\\nbecome too large to remain suspended in the blood-\\nstream. When this occurs, they precipitate out and\\nbecome lodged in the capillaries. This can cause the cap-\\nillary to burst, allowing a local hemorrhage.\\nThe source of the antigen causing AP is unknown.\\nAntigens may be introduced by bacterial or viral infec-\\ntion. More than 75% of patients report having had an\\ninfection of the throat, upper respiratory tract, or gas-\\ntrointestinal system several weeks before the onset of AP.\\nOther complex molecules can act as antigens as well,\\nincluding drugs such as antibiotics or vaccines. Other-\\nwise harmless substances that stimulate an immune reac-\\ntion are known as allergens. Drug allergens that may\\ncause AP include penicillin, ampicillin, erythromycin,\\nand quinine. Vaccines possibly linked to AP include\\nthose for typhoid,measles, cholera, and yellow fever.\\nSymptoms\\nThe onset of AP may be preceded by a headache ,\\nfever, and loss of appetite. Most patients first develop an\\nitchy skin rash. The rash is red, either flat or raised, and\\nmay be small and freckle-like. The rash may also be larg-\\ner, resembling a bruise. Rashes become purple and then\\nrust colored over the course of a day, and fade after sev-\\neral weeks. Rashes are most common on the buttocks,\\nabdomen, and lower extremities. Rashes higher on the\\nbody may also occur, especially in younger children.\\nJoint pain and swelling is common, especially in\\nthe knees and ankles. Abdominal pain occurs in almost\\nall patients, along with blood in the body waste (feces).\\nAbout half of all patients show blood in the urine, low\\nurine volume, or other signs of kidney involvement.\\nKidney failure may occur due to widespread obstruction\\nof the capillaries in the filtering structures called\\nglomeruli. Kidney failure develops in about 5% of all\\npatients, and in 15% of those with elevated blood or pro-\\ntein in the urine.\\nLess common symptoms include prolonged head-\\nache, fever, and pain and swelling of the scrotum. Involve-\\nment of other organ systems may lead to heart attack\\n(myocardial infarction), inflammation of the pancreas\\n(pancreatitis), intestinal obstruction, or bowel perforation.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of AP is based on the symptoms and their\\ndevelopment, a careful medical history, and blood and\\nurine tests. X rays or computed tomography scans (CT)\\nmay be performed to assess complications in the bowel\\nor other internal organs.\\nTreatment\\nMost cases of AP resolve completely without treat-\\nment. Nonetheless, a hospital stay is required because of\\nthe possibility of serious complications. Non-aspirin pain\\nrelievers may be given for joint pain. Corticosteroids(like\\nprednisone) are sometimes used, although not all special-\\nists agree on their utility. Kidney involvement requires\\nmonitoring and correction of blood fluids and electrolytes.\\nPatients with severe kidney complications may\\nrequire a kidney biopsy so that tissue can be analyzed.\\nEven after all other symptoms subside, elevated levels of\\nblood or protein in the urine may persist for months and\\nrequire regular monitoring. Hypertension or kidney fail-\\nure may develop months or even years after the acute\\nphase of the disease. Kidney failure requires dialysis or\\ntransplantation.\\nPlasmapheresis , which removes antibodies from\\nthe blood, has been tried for AP with mixed results.\\nPrognosis\\nMost people who develop AP become better on their\\nown after several weeks.

It affects between 10-20% of all people in\\nthe United States, and is responsible for 2.5% of all doc-\\ntor visits. Antihistamines and other drugs used to treat\\nallergic rhinitis make up a significant fraction of both\\nprescription and over-the-counter drug sales each year.\\nThere are two types of allergic rhinitis: seasonal and\\nperennial. Seasonal AR occurs in the spring, summer,\\nand early fall, when airborne plant pollens are at their\\nhighest levels. In fact, the term hay fever is really a mis-\\nnomer, since allergy to grass pollen is only one cause of\\nsymptoms for most people. Perennial AR occurs all year\\nand is usually caused by home or workplace airborne\\npollutants. A person can be affected by one or both types.\\nSymptoms of seasonal AR are worst after being out-\\ndoors, while symptoms of perennial AR are worst after\\nspending time indoors.\\nBoth types of allergies can develop at any age,\\nalthough onset in childhood through early adulthood is\\nmost common. Although allergy to a particular substance\\nis not inherited, increased allergic sensitivity may “run in\\nthe family.” While allergies can improve on their own\\nover time, they can also become worse over time.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nAllergic rhinitis is a type of immune reaction. Nor-\\nmally, the immune system responds to foreign microor-\\nganisms, or particles, like pollen or dust, by producing\\nspecific proteins, called antibodies, that are capable of\\nbinding to identifying molecules, or antigens, on the for-\\neign particle. This reaction between antibody and antigen\\nsets off a series of reactions designed to protect the body\\nfrom infection. Sometimes, this same series of reactions\\nis triggered by harmless, everyday substances. This is the\\ncondition known as allergy, and the offending substance\\nis called an allergen.\\nLike all allergic reactions, AR involves a special\\nset of cells in the immune system known as mast cells.\\nMast cells, found in the lining of the nasal passages\\nand eyelids, display a special type of antibody, called\\nimmunoglobulin type E (IgE), on their surface. Inside,\\nmast cells store reactive chemicals in small packets,\\ncalled granules. When the antibodies encounter aller-\\ngens, they trigger release of the granules, which spill\\nout their chemicals onto neighboring cells, including\\nblood vessels and nerve cells. One of these chemicals,\\nhistamine, binds to the surfaces of these other cells,\\nthrough special proteins called histamine receptors.\\nInteraction of histamine with receptors on blood ves-\\nsels causes neighboring cells to become leaky, leading\\nto the fluid collection, swelling, and increased redness\\ncharacteristic of a runny nose and red, irritated eyes.\\nHistamine also stimulates pain receptors, causing the\\nitchy, scratchy nose, eyes, and throat common in aller-\\ngic rhinitis.\\nThe number of possible airborne allergens is enor-\\nmous. Seasonal AR is most commonly caused by grass\\nand tree pollens, since their pollen is produced in large\\namounts and is dispersed by the wind. Showy flowers,\\nlike roses or lilacs, that attract insects produce a sticky\\npollen which is less likely to become airborne. Different\\nplants release their pollen at different times of the year,\\nso seasonal AR sufferers may be most affected in spring,\\nsummer, or fall, depending on which plants provoke a\\nresponse. The amount of pollen in the air is reflected in\\nthe pollen count, often broadcast on the daily news dur-\\ning allergy season. Pollen counts tend to be lower after a\\ngood rain that washes the pollen out of the air and higher\\non warm, dry, windy days.\\nVirtually any type of tree or grass may cause AR. A\\nfew types of weeds that tend to cause the most trouble for\\npeople include the following:\\n• ragweed\\n• sagebrush\\n• lamb’s-quarters\\n• plantain\\n• pigweed\\n• dock/sorrel\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 111\\nAllergic rhinitis\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 111'),\n",

House dust contains some or\\nall of the following:\\n• house mite body parts. All houses contain large num-\\nbers of microscopic insects called house mites. These\\nharmless insects feed on fibers, fur, and skin shed by\\nthe house’s larger occupants. Their tiny body parts easi-\\nly become airborne.\\n• animal dander. Animals constantly shed fur, skin flakes,\\nand dried saliva. Carried in the air, or transferred from\\npet to owner by direct contact, dander can cause allergy\\nin many sensitive people.\\n• mold spores. Molds live in damp spots throughout the\\nhouse, including basements, bathrooms, air ducts, air\\nconditioners, refrigerator drains, damp windowsills,\\nmattresses, and stuffed furniture. Mildew and other\\nmolds release airborne spores which circulate through-\\nout the house.\\nOther potential causes of perennial allergic rhinitis\\ninclude the following:\\n• cigarette smoke\\n• perfume\\n• cosmetics\\n• cleansers\\n• copier chemicals\\n• industrial chemicals\\n• construction material gases\\nSymptoms\\nInflammation of the nose, or rhinitis, is the major\\nsymptom of AR. Inflammation causes itching, sneezing,\\nrunny nose, redness, and tenderness. Sinus swelling can\\nconstrict the eustachian tube that connects the inner ear\\nto the throat, causing a congested feeling and “ear pop-\\nping.” The drip of mucus from the sinuses down the back\\nof the throat, combined with increased sensitivity, can\\nalso lead to throat irritation and redness. AR usually also\\ncauses redness, itching, and watery eyes. Fatigue and\\nheadache are also common.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosing seasonal AR is usually easy and can\\noften be done without a medical specialist. When symp-\\ntoms appear in spring or summer and disappear with the\\nonset of cold weather, seasonal AR is almost certainly\\nthe culprit. Other causes of rhinitis, including infection,\\ncan usually be ruled out by a physical examination and\\na nasal smear, in which a sample of mucus is taken on a\\nswab for examination.\\nAllergy tests , including skin testing and provoca-\\ntion testing, can help identify the precise culprit, but\\nmay not be done unless a single source is suspected and\\nsubsequent avoidance is possible. Skin testing involves\\nplacing a small amount of liquid containing a specific\\nallergen on the skin and then either poking, scratching,\\nor injecting it into the skin surface to observe whether\\nredness and swelling occurs. Provocation testing\\ninvolves challenging an individual with either a small\\namount of an inhalable or ingestable allergen to see if a\\nresponse is elicited.\\nPerennial AR can also usually be diagnosed by care-\\nful questioning about the timing of exposure and the\\nonset of symptoms. Specific allergens can be identified\\nthrough allergy skin testing.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2112\\nAllergic rhinitis\\nThis illustration depicts excessive mucus production in the\\nnose after inhalation of airborne pollen.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 126}, page_content='Treatment\\nAvoidance of the allergens is the best treatment, but\\nthis is often not possible. When it is not possible to avoid\\none or more allergens, there are two major forms of med-\\nical treatment, drugs and immunotherapy.\\nDrugs\\nANTIHISTAMINES. Antihistamines block the hista-\\nmine receptors on nasal tissue, decreasing the effect of\\nhistamine release by mast cells. They may be used after\\nsymptoms appear, though they may be even more effec-\\ntive when used preventively, before symptoms appear. A\\nwide variety of antihistamines are available.\\nOlder antihistamines often produce drowsiness as a\\nmajor side effect. Such antihistamines include the fol-\\nlowing:\\n• diphenhydramine (Benadryl and generics)\\n• chlorpheniramine (Chlor-trimeton and generics)\\n• brompheniramine (Dimetane and generics)\\n• clemastine (Tavist and generics).\\nNewer antihistamines that do not cause drowsiness\\nare available by prescription and include the following:\\n• astemizole (Hismanal)\\n• loratidine (Claritin)\\n• fexofenadine (Allegra)\\n• azelastin HCl (Astelin).\\nHismanal has the potential to cause serious heart\\narrhythmias when taken with the antibiotic ery-\\nthromycin, the antifungal drugs ketoconazole and itra-\\nconazole, or the antimalarial drug quinine. Taking more\\nthan the recommended dose of Hismanal can also cause\\narrhythimas. Seldane (terfenadine), the original non-\\ndrowsy antihistamine, was voluntarily withdrawn from\\nthe market by its manufacturers in early 1998 because of\\nthis potential and because of the availability of an equal-\\nly effective, safer alternative drug, fexofenadine.\\nDECONGESTANTS. Decongestants constrict blood\\nvessels to counteract the effects of histamine. Nasal sprays\\nare available that can be applied directly to the nasal lining\\nand oral systemic preparations are available. Decongestants\\nare stimulants and may cause increased heart rate and blood\\npressure, headaches, and agitation. Use of topical deconges-\\ntants for longer than several days can cause loss of effective-\\nness and rebound congestion, in which nasal passages\\nbecome more severely swollen than before treatment.\\nTOPICAL CORTICOSTEROIDS. Topical corticos-\\nteroids reduce mucous membrane inflammation and are\\navailable by prescription. Allergies tend to become worse\\nas the season progresses because the immune system\\nbecomes sensitized to particular antigens and can pro-\\nduce a faster, stronger response. Topical corticosteroids\\nare especially effective at reducing this seasonal sensiti-\\nzation because they work more slowly and last longer\\nthan most other medication types. As a result, they are\\nbest started before allergy season begins. Side effects are\\nusually mild, but may include headaches, nosebleeds,\\nand unpleasant taste sensations.\\nMAST CELL STABILIZERS. Cromolyn sodium prevents\\nthe release of mast cell granules, thereby preventing\\nrelease of histamine and the other chemicals contained in\\nthem. It acts as a preventive treatment if it is begun sever-\\nal weeks before the onset of the allergy season. It can be\\nused for perennial AR as well.\\nImmunotherapy\\nImmunotherapy, also known as desensitization or\\nallergy shots, alters the balance of antibody types in the\\nbody, thereby reducing the ability of IgE to cause allergic\\nreactions. Immunotherapy is preceded by allergy testing\\nto determine the precise allergens responsible. Injections\\ninvolve very small but gradually increasing amounts of\\nallergen, over several weeks or months, with periodic\\nboosters. Full benefits may take up to several years to\\nachieve and are not seen at all in about one in five\\npatients.

It is estimated that 60 million Americans, or\\nmore than one in every five people, suffer from some\\nform of allergy, with similar proportions throughout\\nmuch of the rest of the world. Allergy is the single largest\\nreason for school absence and is a major source of lost\\nproductivity in the workplace.\\nAn allergy is a type of immune reaction. Normally,\\nthe immune system responds to foreign microorganisms\\nor particles by producing specific proteins called anti-\\nbodies. These antibodies are capable of binding to iden-\\ntifying molecules, or antigens, on the foreign particle.\\nThis reaction between antibody and antigen sets off a\\nseries of chemical reactions designed to protect the\\nbody from infection. Sometimes, this same series of\\nreactions is triggered by harmless, everyday substances\\nsuch as pollen, dust, and animal danders. When this\\noccurs, an allergy develops against the offending sub-\\nstance (an allergen.)\\nMast cells, one of the major players in allergic reac-\\ntions, capture and display a particular type of antibody,\\ncalled immunoglobulin type E (IgE) that binds to aller-\\ngens. Inside mast cells are small chemical-filled packets\\ncalled granules. Granules contain a variety of potent\\nchemicals, including histamine.\\nImmunologists separate allergic reactions into two\\nmain types: immediate hypersensitivity reactions, which\\nare predominantly mast cell-mediated and occur within\\nminutes of contact with allergen; and delayed hypersen-\\nsitivity reactions, mediated by T cells (a type of white\\nblood cells) and occurring hours to days after exposure.\\nInhaled or ingested allergens usually cause immedi-\\nate hypersensitivity reactions. Allergens bind to IgE anti-\\nbodies on the surface of mast cells, which spill the con-\\ntents of their granules out onto neighboring cells, includ-\\ning blood vessels and nerve cells. Histamine binds to the\\nsurfaces of these other cells through special proteins\\ncalled histamine receptors. Interaction of histamine with\\nreceptors on blood vessels causes increased leakiness,\\nleading to the fluid collection, swelling and increased\\nredness. Histamine also stimulates pain receptors, mak-\\ning tissue more sensitive and irritable. Symptoms last\\nfrom one to several hours following contact.\\nIn the upper airways and eyes, immediate hypersen-\\nsitivity reactions cause the runny nose and itchy, blood-\\nshot eyes typical of allergic rhinitis. In the gastrointesti-\\nnal tract, these reactions lead to swelling and irritation of\\nthe intestinal lining, which causes the cramping and\\ndiarrheatypical of food allergy. Allergens that enter the\\ncirculation may cause hives, angioedema, anaphylaxis,\\nor atopic dermatitis.\\nAllergens on the skin usually cause delayed hyper-\\nsensitivity reaction. Roving T cells contact the allergen,\\nsetting in motion a more prolonged immune response.\\nThis type of allergic response may develop over several\\ndays following contact with the allergen, and symptoms\\nmay persist for a week or more.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAllergens enter the body through four main routes:\\nthe airways, the skin, the gastrointestinal tract, and the\\ncirculatory system.\\n• Airborne allergens cause the sneezing, runny nose,\\nand itchy, bloodshot eyes of hay fever (allergic rhini-\\ntis). Airborne allergens can also affect the lining of the\\nlungs, causing asthma, or the conjunctiva of the eyes,\\ncausing conjunctivitis (pink eye). Exposure to cock-\\nroach allergans have been associated with the devel-\\nopment of asthma. Airborne allergans from household\\npets are another common source of environmental\\nexposure.\\n• Allergens in food can cause itching and swelling of the\\nlips and throat, cramps, and diarrhea. When absorbed\\ninto the bloodstream, they may cause hives (urticaria)\\nor more severe reactions involving recurrent, non-\\ninflammatory swelling of the skin, mucous membranes,\\norgans, and brain (angioedema). Some food allergens\\nmay cause anaphylaxis,a potentially life-threatening\\ncondition marked by tissue swelling, airwayconstric-\\ntion, and drop in blood pressure. Allergies to foods such\\ncow’s milk, eggs, nuts, fish, and legumes (peanuts and\\nsoybeans) are common. Allergies to fruits and vegeta-\\nbles may also occur.\\n• In contact with the skin, allergens can cause redden-\\ning, itching, and blistering, called contact dermatitis .\\nSkin reactions can also occur from allergens intro-\\nduced through the airways or gastrointestinal tract.\\nThis type of reaction is known as atopic dermatitis .\\nDermatitis may arise from an allergic response (such\\nas from poison ivy), or exposure to an irritant causing\\nnonimmune damage to skin cells (such as soap, cold,\\nand chemical agents).\\n• Injection of allergens, from insect bites and stings or\\ndrug administration, can introduce allergens directly\\ninto the circulation, where they may cause system-wide\\nresponses (including anaphylaxis), as well as the local\\nones of swelling and irritation at the injection site.\\nPeople with allergies are not equally sensitive to\\nall allergens.

For example, childhood ragweed\\nallergy may progress to year-round dust and pollen\\nallergy. On the other hand, a person may lose allergic\\nsensitivity. Infant or childhood atopic dermatitis disap-\\npears in almost all people. More commonly, what\\nseems to be loss of sensitivity is instead a reduced\\nexposure to allergens or an increased tolerance for the\\nsame level of symptoms.\\nWhile allergy to specific allergens is not inherited,\\nthe likelihood of developing some type of allergy seems\\nto be, at least for many people. If neither parent has\\nallergies, the chances of a child developing allergy is\\napproximately 10-20%; if one parent has allergies, it is\\n30-50%; and if both have allergies, it is 40-75%.One\\nsource of this genetic predisposition is in the ability to\\nproduce higher levels of IgE in response to allergens.\\nThose who produce more IgE will develop a stronger\\nallergic sensitivity.\\nCOMMON ALLERGENS. The most common airborne\\nallergens are the following:\\n• plant pollens\\n• animal fur and dander\\n• body parts from house mites (microscopic creatures\\nfound in all houses)\\n• house dust\\n• mold spores\\n• cigarette smoke\\n• solvents\\n• cleaners\\nCommon food allergens include the following:\\n• nuts, especially peanuts, walnuts, and brazil nuts\\n• fish, mollusks, and shellfish\\n• eggs\\n• wheat\\n• milk\\n• food additives and preservatives\\nThe following types of drugs commonly cause aller-\\ngic reactions:\\n• penicillin or other antibiotics\\n• flu vaccines\\n• tetanus toxoid vaccine\\n• gamma globulin\\nCommon causes of contact dermatitis include the\\nfollowing:\\n• poison ivy, oak, and sumac\\n• nickel or nickel alloys\\n• latex\\nInsects and other arthropods whose bites or stings\\ntypically cause allergy include the following:\\n• bees, wasps, and hornets\\n• mosquitoes\\n• fleas\\n• scabies\\nSymptoms depend on the specific type of allergic\\nreaction. Allergic rhinitis is characterized by an itchy,\\nrunny nose, often with a scratchy or irritated throat due\\nto post-nasal drip. Inflammation of the thin membrane\\ncovering the eye (allergic conjunctivitis) causes redness,\\nirritation, and increased tearing in the eyes. Asthma caus-\\nes wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath. Symp-\\ntoms of food allergies depend on the tissues most sensi-\\ntive to the allergen and whether the allergen spread sys-\\ntemically by the circulatory system. Gastrointestinal\\nsymptoms may include swelling and tingling in the lips,\\ntongue, palate or throat; nausea; cramping; diarrhea; and\\ngas. Contact dermatitis is marked by reddened, itchy,\\nweepy skin blisters, and an eczema that is slow to heal. It\\nsometimes has a characteritic man-made pattern, such as\\na glove allergy with clear demarkation on the hands,\\nwrist, and arms where the gloves are worn, or on the ear-\\nlobes by wearing earrings.\\nWhole body or systemic reactions may occur from\\nany type of allergen, but are more common following\\ningestion or injection of an allergen. Skin reactions\\ninclude the raised, reddened, and itchy patches called\\nhives that characteristically blanch with pressure and\\nresolve within twenty-four hours. A deeper and more\\nextensive skin reaction, involving more extensive fluid\\ncollection and pain, is called angioedema. This usually\\noccurs on the extremities, fingers, toes, and parts of the\\nhead,neck,and face. Anaphylaxis is marked by airway\\nconstriction, blood pressure drop, widespread tissue\\nswelling, heart rhythm abnormalities, and in some cases,\\nloss of consciousness. Other syptoms may include,dizzi-\\nness, weakness, seizures, coughing,flushing, or cramp-\\ning. The symptoms may begin within five minutes after\\nexposure to the allergan up to one hour or more later.\\nMast cells in the tissues and basophils in the blood\\nrelease mediators that give rise to the clinical symptoms\\nof this IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction.

Allergy is suspected if\\nthe symptoms presented are characteristic of an allergic\\nreaction and this occurs repeatedly upon exposure to\\nthe suspected allergan. Allergy tests can be used to\\nidentify potential allergens, but these must be supported\\nby eveidence of allergic responses in the patient’s clini-\\ncal history.\\nSkin tests\\nSkin tests are performed by administering a tiny\\ndose of the suspected allergen by pricking, scratching,\\npuncturing or injecting the skin. The allergen is applied\\nto the skin as an auqeous extract, usually on the back,\\nforearms, or top of the thighs. Once in the skin, the aller-\\ngen may produce a classic immune wheal and flare\\nresponse (a skin lesion with a raise, white, compressible\\narea surrounded by a red flare). The tests usually begin\\nwith prick tests or patch tests that expose the skin to\\nsmall amounts of allergen to observe the response. A\\npositive reaction will occur on the skin even if the aller-\\ngen is at levels normally encountered in food or in the\\nairways. Reactions are usually evaluated approximately\\nfifteen minutes after exposure. Intradermal skin tests\\ninvolved injection of the allergan into the dermis of the\\nskin. These tests are more sensitive and are used for\\nallergies associated with risk of death, such as allergies\\nto antibiotics.\\nAllergen-Specific IgE Measurement\\nTests that measure allergen-specific IgE antibodies\\ngenerally follow a basic method. The allergen is bound\\nto a solid support, either in the form of a cellulose\\nsponge, microtiter plate, or paper disk. The patient’s\\nserum is prepared from a blood sample and is incubated\\nwith the solid phase. If allergen specific IgE antibodies\\nare present, they will bind to the solid phase and be\\nretained there when the rest of the serum is washed\\naway. Next, an labeled antibody against the IgE is added\\nand will bind to any IgE on the solid phase.

Some\\nresearch indicates that there is a higher level of total\\nserum IgE in allergic as compared to non-allergic peo-\\nple. However, this may not always be the case as there is\\nconsiderable overlap between the two groups.This test is\\nuseful for the diagnosis of allergic fungal sinusitis and\\nbronchopulmonary aspergillosis . Other conditions that\\nare not allergic in nature may give rise to higher IgE lev-\\nels such as smoking , AIDS, infection with parasites,\\nand IgE myeloma.\\nProvocation tests\\nThese tests involve the administration of allergen to\\nellicit an immune response. Provocation tests, most com-\\nmonly done with airborne allergens, present the allergen\\ndirectly through the route normally involved. Delayed\\nallergic contact dermatitis diagnosis involves similar\\nmethods by application of a skin patch with allergen to\\ninduce an allergic skin reaction. Food allergen provoca-\\ntion tests require abstinence from the suspect allergen for\\ntwo weeks or more, followed by ingestion of a measured\\namount of the test substance administered as an opaque\\ncapsule along with a placebo control. Provocation tests\\nare not used if anaphylaxis is is a concern due to the\\npatient’s medical history.\\nFuture diagnostic methods\\nAs of 2000, attempts have been made for direct\\nmeasurement of immune mediators such as histamine,\\neosinophil cationic protein (ECP), and mast cell\\ntryptase. Another, somewhat controversial,test is elec-\\ntrodermal testing or electro-acupuncture allergy testing.\\nThis test has been used in Europe and is under investiga-\\ntion in the United States, though not approved by the\\nFood and Drug Administration. An electric potential is\\napplied to the skin, the allergen presented, and the elec-\\ntrical resistance observed for changes. This method has\\nnot been verified.\\nTreatment\\nAvoiding allergens is the first line of defense to\\nreduce the possibility of an allergic attack. It is helpful to\\navoid environmental irritants such as tobacco smoke,\\nperfumes, household cleaning agents, paints, glues, air\\nfresheners, and potpourri. Nitrogen dioxide from poorly\\nvented gas stoves, woodburing stoves, and artificial fire-\\nplaces has also been linked to poor asthma control. Dust\\nmite control is particularly important in the bedroom\\nareas by use of allergen-impermeable covers on mattress\\nand pillows, frequent washing of bedding in hot\\nwater,and removal of items that collect dust such as\\nstuffed toys. Mold growth may be reduced by reducing\\nindoor humidity, repair of house foundations to reduce\\nindoor leaks and seepage, and installation of exhaust sys-\\ntems to ventilate areas where steam is generated such as\\nthe bathroom or kitchen. Allergic individuals should\\navoid pet allergens such as saliva, body excretions, pelts,\\nurine, or feces. For those who insist on keeping a pet,\\nrestriction of the animal’s activity to certain areas of the\\nhome may be beneficial.\\nComplete environmental control is often difficult to\\naccomplish, hence therapuetic interventions may\\nbecome necessary. A large number of prescription and\\nover-the-counter drugs are available for treatment of\\nimmediate hypersensitivity reactions. Most of these\\nwork by decreasing the ability of histamine to provoke\\nsymptoms. Other drugs counteract the effects of hista-\\nmine by stimulating other systems or reducing immune\\nresponses in general.\\nAntihistamines\\nAntihistamines block the histamine receptors on\\nnasal tissue, decreasing the effect of histamine released\\nby mast cells. They may be used after symptoms appear,\\nthough they may be even more effective when used pre-\\nventively, before symptoms appear. Antihistamines are\\nhelp reduce sneezing, itching, and rhinorrhea. A wide\\nvariety of antihistamines are available.\\nOlder, first generation antihistamines often produce\\ndrowsiness as a major side effect, as well as dry mouth,\\ntachycardia, blurred vision, constipation, and lower the\\nthreshold for seizures. These medicatios also have simi-\\nlar effects to a alcohol and care should be taken when\\noperating motor vehicles, as individuals may not be\\naware that they are impared.

Education on the use of alternative agents is\\ncritical, as they are still “drugs” even though they are\\nderived from natural sources.Various categories of\\nalternative remedies may be helpful in allergy treat-\\nment, including:\\n• antihistamines: vitamin C and the bioflavonoid hes-\\nperidin act as natural anithistamines.\\n• decongestants: vitamin C, the homeopathic remedies\\nFerrum phosphoricum and Kali muriaticum (used alter-\\nnately), and the dietary supplement N-acetylcysteine\\nare believed to have decongestant effects.\\n• mast cell stabilizers: the bioflavonoids quercetin and\\nhesperidin may help stabilize mast cells.\\n• immunotherapy: the herbs echinacea (Echinacea spp.)\\nand astragalus or milk-vetch root ( Astragalus mem-\\nbranaceus ) may possibly help to strengthen the\\nimmune system.\\n• bronchodilators: the herbal remedies ephedra (Ephedra\\nsinica, also known as ma huang in traditional Chinese\\nmedicine), khellin ( Ammi visnaga ) and cramp bark\\n(Viburnum opulus) are believed to help open the airways.\\nTreatment of contact dermatitis\\nA variety of herbal remedies, either applied topical-\\nly or taken internally, may possibly assist in the treat-\\nment of contact dermatitis. A poultice (crushed herbs\\napplied directly to the affected area) made of jewelweed\\n(Impatiens spp.) or chickweed ( Stellaria media ) may\\nsoothe the skin. A cream or wash containing calendula\\n(Calendula officinalis ), a natural antiseptic and anti-\\ninflammatory agent, may help heal the rash when\\napplied topically. Homeopathic treatment may include\\nsuch remedies as Rhus toxicodendron, Apis mellifica,o r\\nAnacardium taken internally. A qualified homeopathic\\npractitioner should be consulted to match the symptoms\\nwith the correct remedy.

Learning to\\nrecognize and avoid allergy-provoking situations allows\\nmost people with allergies to lead normal lives.\\nPrevention\\nAvoiding allergens is the best means of limiting\\nallergic reactions. For food allergies, there is no effective\\ntreatment except avoidance. By determining the allergens\\nthat are causing reactions, most people can learn to avoid\\nallergic reactions from food, drugs, and contact allergens\\nsuch as poison ivy or latex.

Immunotherapy is preceded by aller-\\ngy testing to determine the precise allergens responsi-\\nble. Injections involve very small but gradually\\nincreasing amounts of allergen, over several weeks or\\nmonths, with periodic boosters. Full benefits may take\\nup to several years to achieve and are not seen at all in\\nabout one in five patients. Individuals receiving all\\nshots will be monitored closely following each shot\\nbecause of the small risk of anaphylaxis, a condition\\nthat can result in difficulty breathing and a sharp drop\\nin blood pressure.\\nOther drugs, including steroids, are used to prevent\\nasthma attacks and in the long-term management of asthma.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nKemp, Stephen F. and Richard Lockey, editors.

Nor-\\nmally, the immune system responds to foreign microor-\\nganisms and particles, like pollen or dust, by producing\\nspecific proteins called antibodies that are capable of\\nbinding to identifying molecules, or antigens, on the\\nforeign organisms. This reaction between antibody and\\nantigen sets off a series of reactions designed to protect\\nthe body from infection. Sometimes, this same series of\\nreactions is triggered by harmless, everyday substances.\\nThis is the condition known as allergy, and the offend-\\ning substance is called an allergen. Common inhaled\\nallergens include pollen, dust, and insect parts from tiny\\nhouse mites. Common food allergens include nuts, fish,\\nand milk.\\nAllergic reactions involve a special set of cells in\\nthe immune system known as mast cells. Mast cells\\nserve as guards in the tissues where the body meets the\\noutside world: the skin, the mucous membranes of the\\neyes and other areas, and the linings of the respiratory\\nand digestive systems. Mast cells display a special type\\nof antibody, called immunoglobulin type E (IgE), on\\ntheir surface. Inside, mast cells store reactive chemicals\\nin small packets, called granules. When the antibodies\\nencounter allergens, they trigger the release of granules,\\nwhich spill out their chemicals onto neighboring cells,\\nincluding blood vessels and nerve cells. One of these\\nchemicals, histamine, binds to the surfaces of these\\nother cells, through special proteins called histamine\\nreceptors. Interaction of histamine with receptors on\\nblood vessels causes neighboring cells to become leaky,\\nleading to the fluid collection, swelling, and increased\\nredness characteristic of a runny nose and red, irritated\\neyes. Histamine also stimulates pain receptors, causing\\nthe itchy, scratchy nose, eyes, and throat common in\\nallergic rhinitis.\\nThe particular allergens to which a person is sensi-\\ntive can be determined through allergy testing. Allergy\\ntests may be performed on the skin or using blood serum\\nin a test tube. During skin tests, potential allergens are\\nplaced on the skin and the reaction is observed. In radio-\\nallergosorbent allergy testing (RAST), a patient’s blood\\nserum is combined with allergen in a test tube to deter-\\nmine if serum antibodies react with the allergen. Provo-\\ncation testing involves direct exposure to a likely aller-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2122\\nAllergy tests\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 122'),\n",

Positive reac-\\ntions from any of these tests may be used to narrow the\\ncandidates for the actual allergen causing the allergy.\\nIdentification of the allergenic substance may allow\\nthe patient to avoid the substance and reduce allergic\\nreactions. In addition, allergy testing may be done in\\nthose with asthma that is difficult to manage, eczema, or\\nskin rashes to determine if an allergy is causing the con-\\ndition or making it worse. Allergy tests may also be done\\nbefore allergen desensitization to ensure the safety of\\nmore extensive exposure.\\nSkin testing is the most common type of allergy test.\\nThere are two forms: percutaneous and intradermal. In\\npercutaneous or prick testing, allergen solutions are\\nplaced on the skin, and the skin is then pricked with a\\nneedle, allowing the allergen to enter the skin and\\nbecome exposed to mast cells. Scratch testing, in which\\nthe skin is scratched instead of punctured, is used less\\noften. Intradermal testing involves directly injecting\\nallergen solutions into the skin. In both tests, a reddened,\\nswollen spot develops at the injection site for each sub-\\nstance to which the person is sensitive. Skin reactivity is\\nseen for allergens regardless of whether they usually\\naffect the skin. In other words, airborne and food aller-\\ngens cause skin reactions equally well.\\nThe range of allergens used for testing is chosen to\\nreflect possible sources in the environment and may\\ninclude the following:\\n• pollen from a variety of trees, common grasses, and\\nweeds\\n• mold and fungus spores\\n• house dust\\n• house mites\\n• animal skin cells (dander) and saliva\\n• food extracts\\n• antibiotics\\n• insect venoms\\nRadio-allergosorbent testing (RAST) is a laboratory\\ntest performed when a person may be too sensitive to risk\\nskin testing or when medications or skin conditions pre-\\nvent it.\\nProvocation testing is done to positively identify\\nsuspected allergens after preliminary skin testing. A puri-\\nfied preparation of the allergen is inhaled or ingested in\\nincreasing concentrations to determine if it will provoke\\na response. Food testing is much more tedious than\\ninhalation testing, since full passage through the diges-\\ntive system may take a day or more.\\nPrecautions\\nWhile allergy tests are quite safe for most people,\\nthe possibility of a condition known as anaphylaxis does\\nexist. Anaphylaxis is a potentially dangerous condition\\nthat can result in difficulty breathing and a sharp drop in\\nblood pressure. People with a known history of anaphy-\\nlaxis should inform the testing clinician. Skin tests\\nshould never include a substance known to cause ana-\\nphylaxis in the person being tested.\\nProvocation tests may cause an allergic reaction.\\nTherefore, treatment medications should be available fol-\\nlowing the tests, to be administered, if needed.\\nDescription\\nIn prick testing, a drop of each allergen to be tested\\nis placed on the skin, usually on the forearm or the back.\\nA typical battery of tests may involve two dozen allergen\\ndrops, including a drop of saline solution that should not\\nprovoke a reaction (negative control) and a drop of hista-\\nmine that should provoke a reaction (positive control). A\\nsmall needle is inserted through the drop, and used to\\nprick the skin below. A new needle is used for each prick.\\nThe sites are examined over the next twenty minutes for\\nevidence of swelling and redness, indicating a positive\\nreaction. In some instances, a tracing of the set of reac-\\ntions may be made by placing paper over the tested area.\\nSimilarly, in intradermal testing, separate injections are\\nmade for each allergen tested. Observations are made\\nover the next twenty minutes.\\nIn RAST testing, a blood sample is taken for use in\\nthe laboratory, where the antibody- containing serum is\\nseparated from the blood cells. The serum is then\\nexposed to allergens bound to a solid medium.

Some causes are considered natural, while oth-\\ners signal serious health problems. Some conditions are\\nconfined to the scalp. Others reflect disease throughout\\nthe body. Being plainly visible, the skin and its compo-\\nnents can provide early signs of disease elsewhere in the\\nbody.\\nOftentimes, conditions affecting the skin of the scalp\\nwill result in hair loss. The first clue to the specific cause\\nis the pattern of hair loss, whether it be complete bald-\\nness (alopecia totalis), patchy bald spots, thinning, or\\nhair loss confined to certain areas. Also a factor is the\\ncondition of the hair and the scalp beneath it. Sometimes\\nonly the hair is affected; sometimes the skin is visibly\\ndiseased as well.\\nCauses and symptoms\\n• Male pattern baldness (androgenic alopecia) is consid-\\nered normal in adult males. It is easily recognized by\\nthe distribution of hair loss over the top and front of the\\nhead and by the healthy condition of the scalp.\\n• Alopecia areata is a hair loss condition of unknown\\ncause that can be patchy or extend to complete baldness.\\n• Fungal infections of the scalp usually cause patchy hair\\nloss. The fungus, similar to the ones that cause athlete’s\\nfoot and ringworm, often glows under ultraviolet light.\\n• Trichotillomania is the name of a mental disorder that\\ncauses a person to pull out his/her own hair.\\n• Complete hair loss is a common result of cancer\\nchemotherapy, due to the toxicity of the drugs used.\\nPlacing a tourniquet around the skull just above the ears\\nduring the intravenous infusion of the drugs may\\nreduce or eliminate hair loss by preventing the drugs\\nfrom reaching the scalp.\\n• Systemic diseases often affect hair growth either selec-\\ntively or by altering the skin of the scalp. One example\\nis thyroid disorders. Hyperthyroidism (too much thy-\\nroid hormone) causes hair to become thin and fine.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 125\\nAlopecia\\nTop of balding male’s head.(Photograph by Kelly A.

For more obscure diseases, they may have to\\nresort to a skin biopsy, removing a tiny bit of skin using\\na local anesthetic so that it can examined under a micro-\\nscope. Systemic diseases will require a complete evalua-\\ntion by a physician, including specific tests to identify\\nand characterize the problem.\\nTreatment\\nSuccessful treatment of underlying causes is most\\nlikely to restore hair growth, be it the completion of\\nchemotherapy, effective cure of a scalp fungus, or control\\nof a systemic disease. Two relatively new drugs—minox-\\nidil (Rogaine) and finasteride (Proscar)—promote hair\\ngrowth in a significant minority of patients, especially\\nthose with male pattern baldness and alopecia areata.\\nWhile both drugs have so far proved to be quite safe\\nwhen used for this purpose,minoxidil is a liquid that is\\napplied to the scalp and finasteride is the first and only\\napproved treatment in a pill form.\\nMinoxidil was approved for over-the-counter sales\\nin 1996.

This screening test mea-\\nsures the level of AFP in the mother’s blood and indi-\\ncates the probability that the fetus has one of several seri-\\nous birth defects . The level of AFP can also be deter-\\nmined by analyzing a sample of amniotic fluid. This\\nscreening test cannot diagnose a specific condition; it\\nonly indicates the increase of risk for several birth\\ndefects. Outside pregnancy, the AFP test is used to detect\\nliver disease, certain cancerous tumors, and to monitor\\nthe progress of cancer treatment.\\nPurpose\\nAlpha-fetoprotein is a substance produced by the\\nliver of a fetus. The exact function of this protein is\\nunknown. After birth, the infant’s liver stops producing\\nAFP, and an adult liver contains only trace amounts.\\nDuring pregnancy, the fetus excretes AFP in urine and\\nsome of the protein crosses the fetal membranes to enter\\nthe mother’s blood. The level of AFP can then be deter-\\nmined by analyzing a sample of the mother’s blood. By\\nanalyzing the amount of AFP found in a blood or amni-\\notic fluid sample, doctors can determine the probability\\nthat the fetus is at risk for certain birth defects. It is very\\nimportant that the doctor know precisely how old the\\nfetus is when the test is performed since the AFP level\\nchanges over the length of the pregnancy. Alone, AFP\\nscreening cannot diagnose a birth defect. The test is\\nused as an indicator of risk and then an appropriate line\\nof testing (like amniocentesis or ultrasound) follows,\\nbased on the results.\\nAbnormally high AFP may indicate that the fetus\\nhas an increased risk of a neural tube defect, the most\\ncommon and severe type of disorder associated with\\nincreased AFP. These types of defects include spinal\\ncolumn defects (spina bifida ) and anencephaly (a\\nsevere and usually fatal brain abnormality). If the tube\\nthat becomes the brain and spinal cord does not close\\ncorrectly during fetal development, AFP may leak\\nthrough this abnormal opening and enter the amniotic\\nfluid. This leakage creates abnormally high levels of\\nAFP in amniotic fluid and in maternal blood. If the\\nscreening test indicates abnormally high AFP, ultra-\\nsound is used to diagnosis the problem.\\nOther fetal conditions that can raise AFP levels\\nabove normal include:\\n• cysts at the end of the spine\\n• blockage in the esophagus or intestines\\n• liver disease causing liver cells to die\\n• defects in the abdominal wall\\n• kidney or urinary tract defects or disease\\n• brittle bone disease\\nLevels may also be high if there is too little fluid in\\nthe amniotic sac around the fetus, more than one devel-\\noping fetus, or a pregnancy that is farther along than\\nestimated.\\nFor unknown reasons, abnormally low AFP may\\nindicate that the fetus has an increased risk of Down\\nsyndrome . Down syndrome is a condition that\\nincludes mental retardation and a distinctive physical\\nappearance linked to an abnormality of chromosome\\n21 (called trisomy 21). If the screening test indicates\\nan abnormally low AFP, amniocentesis is used to diag-\\nnosis the problem. Abnormally low levels of AFP can\\nalso occur when the fetus has died or when the mother\\nis overweight.\\nAFP is often part of a “triple check” blood test that\\nanalyzes three substances as risk indicators of possible\\nbirth defects: AFP, estriol, and human chorionic\\ngonadotropin (HCG). When all three substances are mea-\\nsured in the mother’s blood, the accuracy of the test\\nresults increases.\\nAlthough AFP in human blood gradually disappears\\nafter birth, it never disappears entirely. It may reappear in\\nliver disease, or tumors of the liver, ovaries, or testicles.\\nThe AFP test is used to screen people at high risk for\\nthese conditions.

Contin-\\nued high AFP levels suggest the cancer is growing.\\nPrecautions\\nIt is very important that the doctor know precisely\\nhow old the fetus is when the test is performed since the\\nAFP level considered normal changes over the length of\\nthe pregnancy. Errors in determining the age of the fetus\\nlead to errors when interpreting the test results.

This causes vasodilation and allows\\nblood to flow more easily.\\nPurpose\\nThese drugs, called alpha blockers for short, are\\nused for two main purposes: to treat high blood pressure\\n(hypertension) and to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia\\n(BPH), a condition that affects men and is characterized\\nby an enlarged prostate gland.\\nHigh blood pressure\\nHigh blood pressure puts a strain on the heart and\\nthe arteries. Over time, hypertension can damage the\\nblood vessels to the point of causing stroke, heart fail-\\nure or kidney failure. People with high blood pressure\\nmay also be at higher risk for heart attacks. Controlling\\nhigh blood pressure makes these problems less likely.\\nAlpha blockers help lower blood pressure by causing\\nvasodilation, meaning an increase in the diameter of the\\nblood vessels, which allows blood to flow more easily.\\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)\\nThis condition particularly affects older men. Over\\ntime, the prostate, a donut-shaped gland below the blad-\\nder, enlarges. When this happens, it may interfere with\\nthe passage of urine from the bladder out of the body.\\nMen who are diagnosed with BPH may have to urinate\\nmore often. Or they may feel that they can not complete-\\nly empty their bladders. Alpha blockers inhibit the con-\\ntraction of prostatic smooth muscle and thus relax mus-\\ncles in the prostate and the bladder, allowing urine to\\nflow more freely.\\nDescription\\nCommonly prescribed alpha blockers for hyperten-\\nsion and BPH include doxazosin (Cardura, prazosin\\n(Minipress) and terazosin (Hytrin). Prazosin is also used\\nin the treatment of heart failure. All are available only\\nwith a physician’s prescription and are sold in tablet form.\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe recommended dose depends on the patient and\\nthe type of alpha blocker and may change over the course\\nof treatment. The prescribing physician will gradually\\nincrease the dosage, if necessary. Some patients may need\\nas much as 15-20 mg per day of terazosin, 16 mg per day\\nof doxazosin, or as much as 40 mg per day of prazosin,\\nbut most people benefit from lower doses. As the dosage\\nincreases, so does the possibility of unwanted side effects.\\nAlpha blockers should be taken exactly as directed,\\neven if the medication does not seem to be working at\\nfirst. It should not be stopped even if symptoms improve\\nbecause it needs to be taken regularly to be effective.\\nPatients should avoid missing any doses, and should not\\ntake larger or more frequent doses to make up for\\nmissed doses.\\nPrecautions\\nAlpha blockers may lower blood pressure to a\\ngreater extent than desired. This can cause dizziness ,\\nlightheadedness, heart palpitations, and fainting. Activ-\\nities such as driving, using machines, or doing anything\\nelse that might be dangerous for 24 hours after taking the\\nfirst dose should be avoided. Patients should be reminded\\nto be especially careful not to fall when getting up in the\\nmiddle of the night. The same precautions are recom-\\nmended if the dosage is increased or if the drug has been\\nstopped and then started again. Anyone whose safety on\\nthe job could be affected by taking alpha blockers should\\ninform his or her physician, so that the physician can\\ntake this factor into account when increasing dosage.\\nDizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting are more like-\\nly to occur when people taking alpha blockers also drink\\nalcohol,exercise, stand for a long time, or are exposed to\\nhot weather. Extra care should be used under these condi-\\ntions and alcohol consumption should be limited.\\nSome people may feel drowsy or less alert when\\nusing these drugs. They should accordingly avoid driving\\nor performing activities that require full attention.\\nPeople diagnosed with kidney disease or liver disease\\nmay also be more sensitive to alpha blockers. They should\\ninform their physicians about these conditions if alpha\\nblockers are prescribed. Older people may also be more\\nsensitive and may be more likely to have unwanted side\\neffects, such as fainting, dizziness, and lightheadedness.\\nIt should be noted that alpha blockers do not cure\\nhigh blood pressure. They simply help to keep the condi-\\ntion under control. Similarly, these drugs will not shrink\\nan enlarged prostate gland. Although they will help\\nrelieve the symptoms of prostate enlargement, the\\nprostate may continue to grow, and it eventually may be\\nnecessary to have prostate surgery.\\nAlpha blockers may lower blood counts. Patients\\nmay need to have their blood checked regularly while\\ntaking this medicine.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 129\\nAlpha1-adrenergic blockers\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 129'),\n",

All varieties of the syndrome\\nare characterized by kidney disease that usually pro-\\ngresses to chronic kidney failure and by uremia (the\\npresence of excessive amounts of urea and other waste\\nproducts in the blood).\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAlport syndrome in most cases is caused by a defect\\nin one or more genes located on the X chromosome. It is\\nusually inherited from the mother, who is a normal carri-\\ner. However, in up to 20% of cases there is no family his-\\ntory of the disorder. In these cases, there appears to be a\\nspontaneous genetic mutation causing Alport syndrome.\\nBlood in the urine (hematuria) is a hallmark of\\nAlport syndrome. Other symptoms that may appear in\\nvarying combinations include:\\n• protein in the urine (proteinuria)\\n• sensorineural hearing loss\\n• eye problems [involuntary, rhythmic eye movements\\n(nystagmus), cataracts, or cornea problems]\\n• skin problems\\n• platelet disorders\\n• abnormal white blood cells\\n• smooth muscle tumors\\nKEY TERMS\\nAlbumin—A protein that is important in maintain-\\ning blood volume. Low albumin levels is one sign\\nof Alport syndrome.\\nDialysis—A technique of removing waste material\\nfrom the blood. It is used with patients whose kid-\\nneys have stopped functioning and can no longer\\ncleanse the blood on their own.\\nDiuretic —A drug that increases the amount of\\nurine a person produces.\\nHematuria —Blood in the urine, Hematuria is a\\nhallmark of Alport syndrome.\\nPulmonary edema —Excess fluid in the air spaces\\nof the lungs.\\nUremia—The presence of excessive amounts of\\nurea and other waste products in the blood.\\nNot all patients with Alport syndrome have hearing\\nproblems. In general, those with normal hearing have\\nless severe cases of Alport syndrome.\\nDiagnosis\\nAlport syndrome is diagnosed with a medical evalu-\\nation and family history, together with a kidney biopsy\\nthat can detect changes in the kidney typical of the condi-\\ntion. Urinalysis may reveal blood or protein in the urine.\\nBlood tests can reveal a low platelet level.\\nIn addition, tests for the Alport gene are now avail-\\nable. Although testing is fairly expensive, it is covered by\\nmany types of health insurance. DNA tests can diagnose\\naffected children even before birth, and genetic linkage\\ntests tracing all family members at risk for Alport syn-\\ndrome are also available.\\nTreatment\\nThere is no specific treatment that can “cure” Alport\\nsyndrome. Instead, care is aimed at easing the problems\\nrelated to kidney failure, such as the presence of too\\nmany waste products in the blood (uremia).\\nTo control kidney inflammation (nephritis), patients\\nshould:\\n• restrict fluids\\n• control high blood pressure\\n• manage pulmonary edema\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 131\\nAlport syndrome\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 131'),\n",

High altitude is defined as\\nheight greater than 8,000 feet (2,438 m); medium altitude\\nis defined as height between 5,000 and 8,000 feet\\n(1,524–2,438 m); and extreme altitude is defined as\\nheight greater than 19,000 feet (5,791 m). The majority\\nof healthy individuals suffer from altitude sickness when\\nthey reach very high altitudes. In addition, about 20% of\\npeople ascending above 9,000 (2,743 m) feet in one day\\nwill develop altitude sickness. Children under six years\\nand women in the premenstrual part of their cycles may\\nbe more vulnerable. Individuals with preexisting medical\\nconditions—even a minor respiratory infection—may\\nbecome sick at more moderate altitudes.\\nDescription\\nThere are three major clinical syndromes that fall\\nunder the heading of altitude sickness: acute mountain\\nsickness (AMS), high-altitude pulmonary edema\\n(HAPE), and high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE).\\nThese syndromes are not separate, individual syndromes\\nas much as they are a continuum of severity, all resulting\\nfrom a decrease in oxygen in the air. AMS is the mildest,\\nand the other two represent severe, life-threatening forms\\nof altitude sickness.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2132\\nAltitude sickness\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 132'),\n",

(Partial pressure is a\\nterm applied to gases that is similar to the way the term\\nconcentration is applied to liquid solutions.) For instance,\\nat 18,000 feet (5,486 m) the partial pressure of oxygen\\ndrops to one-half its value at sea level and, therefore, there\\nis a substantially lower amount of oxygen available for the\\nindividual to inhale. This is known as hypoxia. Further-\\nmore, since there is less oxygen to inhale, less oxygen\\nreaches the blood. This is known as hypoxemia. These two\\nconditions are the major factors that form the basis for all\\nthe medical problems associated with altitude sickness.\\nAs a person becomes hypoxemic, his natural\\nresponse is to breathe more rapidly (hyperventilate). This\\nis the body’s attempt to bring in more oxygen at a rapid\\nrate. This attempt at alleviating the effects of the hypoxia\\nat higher altitudes is known as acclimatization, and it\\noccurs during the first few days. Acclimatization is a\\nresponse that occurs in individuals who travel from lower\\nto higher altitudes. There are groups of people who have\\nlived at high altitudes (for example, in the Himalayan\\nand Andes mountains) for generations, and they are sim-\\nply accustomed to living at such altitudes, perhaps\\nthrough a genetic ability.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAcute mountain sickness (AMS) is a mild form of\\naltitude sickness that results from ascent to altitudes higher\\ngreater than 8,000 feet (2,438 m)—even 6,500 feet (1,981\\nm) in some susceptible individuals. Although hypoxia is\\nassociated with the development of AMS, the exact mech-\\nanism by which this condition develops has yet to be con-\\nfirmed. It is important to realize that some individuals\\nacclimatize to higher altitudes more efficiently than others.\\nAs a result, under similar conditions some will suffer from\\nAMS while others will not. At present, the susceptibility\\nof otherwise healthy individuals to contracting AMS can-\\nnot be accurately predicted. Of those who do suffer from\\nAMS, the condition tends to be most severe on the second\\nor third day after reaching the high altitude, and it usually\\nabates after three to five days if they remain at the same\\naltitude. However, it can recur if the individuals travel to\\nan even higher altitude. Symptoms usually appear a few\\nhours to a few days following ascent, and they include\\ndizziness, headache, shortness of breath, nausea, vomit-\\ning, loss of appetite, and insomnia.\\nHigh-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) is a life-\\nthreatening condition that afflicts a small percentage of\\nthose who suffer from AMS. In this condition, fluid leaks\\nfrom within the pulmonary blood vessels into the lung\\ntissue. As this fluid begins to accumulate within the lung\\ntissue (pulmonary edema), the individual begins to\\nKEY TERMS\\nCerebral—Pertaining to the brain.\\nEdema—Accumulation of excess fluid in the tis-\\nsues of the body.\\nHypoxemia—Insufficient oxygenation of the blood.\\nHypoxia—A deficiency in the amount of oxygen\\nrequired for effective ventilation.\\nPulmonary—Pertaining to the lungs.\\nbecome more and more short of breath. HAPE is known\\nto afflict all types of individuals, regardless of their level\\nof physical fitness.\\nTypically, the individual who suffers from HAPE\\nascends quickly to a high altitude and almost immediate-\\nly develops shortness of breath, a rapid heart rate, a\\ncoughproductive of a large amount of sometimes bloody\\nsputum, and a rapid rate of breathing. If no medical assis-\\ntance is provided by this point, the patient goes into a\\ncomaand dies within a few hours.\\nHigh-altitude cerebral edema (HACE), the rarest and\\nmost severe form of altitude sickness, involves cerebral\\nedema, and its mechanism of development is also poorly\\nunderstood. The symptoms often begin with those of\\nAMS, but neurologic symptoms such as an altered level\\nof consciousness, speech abnormalities, severe headache,\\nloss of coordination,hallucinations , and even seizures.\\nIf no intervention is implemented, death is the result.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis for altitude sickness may be made\\nfrom the observation of the individual’s symptoms dur-\\ning travel to higher altitudes.\\nTreatment\\nMild AMS requires no treatment other than an\\naspirin or ibuprofen for headache, and avoidance of fur-\\nther ascent. Narcotics should be avoided because they\\nmay blunt the respiratory response, making it even more\\ndifficult for the person to breathe deeply and rapidly\\nenough to compensate for the lower levels of oxygen in\\nthe environment. Oxygen may also be used to alleviate\\nsymptoms of mild AMS.\\nAs for HAPE and HACE, the most important course\\nof action is descent to a lower altitude as soon as possi-\\nble.

In addition,\\ndexamethasone (a steroid) has been suggested in order to\\nreduce cerebral edema.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for mild AMS is good, if appropriate\\nmeasures are taken. As for HAPE and HACE, the prog-\\nnosis depends upon the rapidity and distance of descent\\nand the availability of medical intervention. Descent\\noften leads to improvement of symptoms, however,\\nrecovery times vary among individuals.\\nPrevention\\nWhen individuals ascend from sea level, it is recom-\\nmended that they spend at least one night at an interme-\\ndiate altitude prior to ascending to higher elevations. In\\ngeneral, climbers should take at least two days to go\\nfrom sea level to 8,000 feet (2,438 m). After reaching\\nthat point, healthy climbers should generally allow one\\nday for each additional 2,000 feet (610 m), and one day\\nof rest should be taken every two or three days. Should\\nmild symptoms begin to surface, further ascent should be\\navoided. If the symptoms are severe, the individual\\nshould return to a lower altitude. Some reports indicate\\nthat acetazolamide (a diuretic) may be taken before\\nascent as a preventative measure for AMS.\\nPaying attention to diet can also help prevent alti-\\ntude sickness. Water loss is a problem at higher altitudes,\\nso climbers should drink ample water (enough to pro-\\nduce copious amounts of relatively light-colored or clear\\nurine). Alcohol and large amounts of salt should be\\navoided.

AD usually occurs in old age, and\\nis marked by a decline in cognitive functions such as\\nremembering, reasoning, and planning.\\nDescription\\nA person with AD usually has a gradual decline in\\nmental functions, often beginning with slight memory\\nloss, followed by losses in the ability to maintain\\nemployment, to plan and execute familiar tasks, and to\\nreason and exercise judgment. Communication ability,\\nmood, and personality may also be affected. Most people\\nwho have AD die within eight years of their diagnosis,\\nalthough that interval may be as short as one year or as\\nlong as 20 years. AD is the fourth leading cause of death\\nin adults after heart disease, cancer, and stroke.\\nBetween two and four million Americans have AD;\\nthat number is expected to grow to as many as 14 million by\\nthe middle of the 21st century as the population as a whole\\nages. While a small number of people in their 40s and 50s\\ndevelop the disease (called early-onset AD), AD predomi-\\nnantly affects the elderly. AD affects about 3% of all people\\nbetween ages 65 and 74, about 19% of those between 75\\nand 84, and about 47% of those over 85. Slightly more\\nwomen than men are affected with AD, but this may be\\nbecause women tend to live longer, and so there is a higher\\nproportion of women in the most affected age groups.\\nThe costs for caring for a person with AD is consid-\\nerable. The annual cost of caring for one AD patient in\\n1998 was estimated as about $18,400 for a patient with\\nmild AD, $30,100 for a patient with moderate AD, and\\n$36,100 for a patient with severe AD. The annual direct\\nand indirect costs of caring for AD patients in the United\\nStates was estimated to be as much as $100 billion.\\nSlightly more than half of AD patients are cared for at\\nhome, while the remainder are cared for in a variety of\\nhealth care institutions.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nThe cause or causes of Alzheimer’s disease are\\nunknown. Some strong leads have been found through\\nrecent research, however, and these have also given some\\ntheoretical support to several new experimental treatments.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2134\\nAlzheimer’s disease\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 134'),\n",

As these neurons in the hippocampus\\nstop functioning, the short-term memory of the person\\nfails, and the ability to perform familiar tasks decreases.\\nLater AD affects the cerebral cortex, particularly the areas\\nresponsible for language and reasoning; this language\\nskills are lost and the ability to make judgments is\\nchanged. Personality changes occur, which may include\\nemotional outbursts, wandering, and agitation. The sever-\\nity of these changes increases with the progression of the\\ndisease. Eventually many other areas of the brain become\\ninvolved, the brain regions affected atrophy (shrink and\\nlose function), and the person with AD becomes bedrid-\\nden, incontinent, helpless, and non-responsive.\\nAutopsy of a person with AD shows that the regions\\nof the brain affected by the disease become clogged with\\ntwo abnormal structures, called neurofibrillary tangles\\nand amyloid plaques. Neurofibrillary tangles are twisted\\nmasses of protein fibers inside nerve cells, or neurons. In\\nAD, tau proteins, which normally help bind and stabilize\\nparts of neurons, is changed chemically, become twisted\\nand tangled, and no longer can stabilize the neurons.\\nAmyloid plaques consist of insoluble deposits of beta-\\namyloid (a protein fragment from a larger protein called\\namyloid precursor protein (APP) mixed with parts of neu-\\nrons and non-nerve cells.

They act by increasing the level of\\nchemical signaling molecules in the brain, known as neu-\\nrotransmitters, to make up for this decreased communica-\\ntion ability. All act by inhibiting the activity of acetyl-\\ncholinesterase, which is an enzyme that breaks down\\nacetylcholine, an important neurotransmitter released by\\nneurons that is necessary for cognitive function. These\\ndrugs modestly increase cognition and improve one’s\\nability to perform normal activities of daily living.\\nWhat triggers the formation of plaques and tangles\\nand the development of AD are unknown. AD likely\\nresults from many interrelated factors, including genetic,\\nenvironmental, and others not yet identified. Two types\\nof AD exist: familial AD (FAD), which is a rare autoso-\\nmal dominant inherited disease, and sporadic AD, with\\nno obvious inheritance pattern. AD is also described in\\nterms of age at onset, with early on-set AD occurring in\\npeople younger than 65, and late-onset occurring in those\\n65 and older. Early on-set AD comprises about 5-10 of\\nAD cases and affects people aged 30 to 60. Some cases\\nof early on-set AD are inherited and are common in some\\nfamilies. Early-onset AD often progresses faster than the\\nmore common late-on-set type.\\nAll FAD, which are relatively uncommon, that have\\nbeen identified so far are the early on-set type. As many\\nas 50% of the FAD cases are known to be caused by three\\ngenes located on three different chromosomes. Some\\nfamilies have mutations in the APP gene located on chro-\\nmosome 21, which causes the production of abnormal\\nAPP protein. Others have mutations in a gene called pre-\\nsenilin 1 located on chromosome 14, which causes the\\nproduction of abnormal presenilin 1 protein, and others\\nhave mutations in a similar gene called presenilin 2 locat-\\ned on chromosome 1, which causes production of abnor-\\nmal presenilin 2. Presenilin 1 may be one of the enzymes\\nthat clips APP into beta-amyloid; it may also be important\\nin the synaptic connections between brain cells.\\nThere is no evidence that the mutated genes that\\ncause early on-set FAD also cause late on-set AD, but\\ngenetics does appear to play a role in this more common\\nform of AD. Discovered by researchers at Duke Univer-\\nsity in the early 1990s, potentially the most important\\ngenetic link to AD was on chromosome 19. A gene on\\nthis chromosome, called APOE (apolipoprotein E), codes\\nfor a protein involved in transporting lipids into neurons.\\nAPOE occurs in at least three forms (alleles), called\\nAPOE e2, APOE e3, and APOE e4. Each person inherits\\none APOE from each parent, and therefore can either\\nhave one copy of two different forms, or two copies of\\none. The relatively rare APOE e2 appears to protect some\\npeople from AD, as it seems to be associated with a\\nlower risk of AD and a later age of onset if AD does\\ndevelop. APOE e3 is the most common version found in\\nthe general population, and only appears to have a neu-\\ntral role in AD. However, APOE e4 appears to increase\\nthe risk of developing late onset AD with the inheritance\\nof one or two copies of APOE e4. Compared to those\\nwithout APOE e4, people with one copy are about three\\ntimes as likely to develop late-onset AD, and those with\\ntwo copies are almost four times as likely to do so. Hav-\\ning APOE e4 can also lower the age of onset by as much\\nas 17 years. However, APOE e4 only increases the risk of\\ndeveloping AD and does not cause it, as not everyone\\nwith APOE e4 develops AD, and people without it can\\nstill have the disease. Why APOE e4 increases the\\nchances of developing AD is not known with certainty.\\nHowever, one theory is that APOE e4 facilitates beta-\\namyloid buildup in plaques, thus contributing to the low-\\nering of the age of onset of AD; other theories involve\\ninteractions with cholesterol levels and effects on nerve\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 135\\nAlzheimer’s disease\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 135'),\n",

In\\n2000, four new AD-related regions in the human genome\\nwere identified, where one out of several hundred genes\\nin each of these regions may be a risk factor gene for AD.\\nThese genes, which are not yet identified, appear to make\\na contribution to the risk of developing late-onset AD\\nthat is at least as important as APOE e4.\\nOther non-genetic factors have also been studied in\\nrelation to the causes of AD. Inflammation of the brain\\nmay play a role in development of AD, and use of nons-\\nteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) seems to\\nreduce the risk of developing AD. Restriction of blood\\nflow may be part of the problem, perhaps accounting for\\nthe beneficial effects of estrogen, which increases blood\\nflow in the brain, among its other effects. Highly reactive\\nmolecular fragments called free radicals damage cells of\\nall kinds, especially brain cells, which have smaller sup-\\nplies of protective antioxidants thought to protect against\\nfree radical damage. Vitamin E is one such antioxidant,\\nand its use in AD may be of possible theoretical benefit.\\nWhile the ultimate cause or causes of Alzheimer’s\\ndisease are still unknown, there are several risk factors\\nthat increase a person’s likelihood of developing the dis-\\nease. The most significant one is, of course, age; older\\npeople develop AD at much higher rates than younger\\nones. There is some evidence that strokes and AD may be\\nlinked, with small strokes that go undetected clinically\\ncontributing to the injury of neurons. Blood cholesterol\\nlevels may also be important. Scientists have shown that\\nhigh blood cholesterol levels in special breeds of geneti-\\ncally engineered (transgenic) mice may increase the rate\\nof plaque deposition. There are also parallels between\\nAD and other progressive neurodegenerative disorders\\nthat cause dementia, including prion diseases, Parkin-\\nson’s disease, and Huntington’s disease.\\nNumerous epidemiological studies of populations are\\nalso being conducted to learn more about whether and to\\nwhat extent early life events, socioeconomic factors, and\\nethnicity have an impact on the development of AD. For\\nexample, results from one study indicated that rural resi-\\ndence in childhood, along with fewer than six years of\\nschooling, was associated with increased AD risk. How-\\never, the low educational attainment that was identified as\\na risk factor might be a marker or surrogate for other dele-\\nterious socioeconomic or environmental influences in\\nchildhood, thus illustrating the difficulties in interpreting\\nepidemiological findings, due to the complexity of the\\nissues and the large number of variables involved.\\nMany environmental factors have been suspected of\\ncontributing to AD, but epidemiological population stud-\\nies have not borne out these links. Among these have\\nbeen pollutants in drinking water, aluminum from com-\\nmercial products, and metal dental fillings. To date, none\\nof these factors has been shown to cause AD or increase\\nits likelihood. Further research may yet turn up links to\\nother environmental factors.\\nSymptoms\\nThe symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease begin gradu-\\nally, usually with memory lapses. Occasional memory\\nlapses are of course common to everyone, and do not by\\nthemselves signify any change in cognitive function. The\\nperson with AD may begin with only the routine sort of\\nmemory lapse—forgetting where the car keys are—but\\nprogress to more profound or disturbing losses, such as\\nforgetting that he or she can even drive a car. Becoming\\nlost or disoriented on a walk around the neighborhood\\nbecomes more likely as the disease progresses. A person\\nwith AD may forget the names of family members, or\\nforget what was said at the beginning of a sentence by\\nthe time he hears the end.\\nAs AD progresses, other symptoms appear, includ-\\ning inability to perform routine tasks, loss of judgment,\\nand personality or behavior changes. Some patients have\\ntrouble sleeping and may suffer from confusion or agita-\\ntion in the evening (“sunsetting” or Sundowner’s Syn-\\ndrome). In some cases, people with AD repeat the same\\nideas, movements, words, or thoughts, a behavior known\\nas perseveration. In the final stages people may have\\nsevere problems with eating, communicating, and con-\\ntrolling their bladder and bowel functions.\\nThe Alzheimer’s Association has developed a list of ten\\nwarning signs of AD. A person with several of these symp-\\ntoms should see a physician for a thorough evaluation:\\n• memory loss that affects job skills\\n• difficulty performing familiar tasks\\n• problems with language\\n• disorientation of time and place\\n• poor or decreased judgment\\n• problems with abstract thinking\\n• misplacing things\\n• changes in mood or behavior\\n• changes in personality\\n• loss of initiative\\nOther types of dementia, including some that are\\nreversible, can cause similar symptoms. It is important for\\nthe person with these symptoms to be evaluated by a pro-\\nfessional who can weigh the possibility that his or her\\nsymptoms may have another cause. Approximately 20% of\\nthose originally suspected of having AD turn out to have\\nsome other disorder; about half of these cases are treatable.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2136\\nAlzheimer’s disease\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 136'),\n",

Except in the\\ndisease’s earliest stages, accurate history from family\\nmembers or caregivers is essential. Since there are both\\nprescription and over-the-counter drugs that can cause\\nthe same mental changes as AD, a careful review of the\\npatient’s drug, medicine, and alcohol use is important.\\nAD-like symptoms can also be provoked by other med-\\nical conditions, including tumors, infection, and demen-\\ntia caused by mild strokes (multi-infarct dementia).\\nThese possibilities must be ruled out as well through\\nappropriate blood and urine tests, brain magnetic reso-\\nnance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography\\n(PET) or single photon emission computed tomography\\n(SPECT) scans, tests of the brain’s electrical activity\\n(electroencephalographs or EEGs), or other tests. Several\\ntypes of oral and written tests are used to aid in the AD\\ndiagnosis and to follow its progression, including tests of\\nmental status, functional abilities, memory, and concen-\\ntration. Still, the neurologic exam is normal in most\\npatients in early stages.\\nOne of the most important parts of the diagnostic\\nprocess is to evaluate the patient for depression and\\ndelirium, since each of these can be present with AD,\\nor may be mistaken for it. (Delirium involves a\\ndecreased consciousness or awareness of one’s environ-\\nment.) Depression and memory loss are both common\\nin the elderly, and the combination of the two can often\\nbe mistaken for AD. Depression can be treated with\\ndrugs, although some antidepressants can worsen\\ndementia if it is present, further complicating both diag-\\nnosis and treatment.\\nAn early and accurate diagnosis of AD is important\\nin developing strategies for managing symptoms and for\\nhelping patients and their families planning for the future\\nand pursuing care options while the patient can still take\\npart in the decision-making process.\\nA genetic test for the APOE e4 gene is available, but\\nis not used for diagnosis, since possessing even two\\ncopies does not ensure that a person will develop AD. In\\naddition, access to genetic information could affect the\\ninsurability of a patient if disclosed, and also affect\\nemployment status and legal rights.\\nTreatment\\nAlzheimer’s disease is presently incurable, so there-\\nfore the mainstay of treatment for a person with AD is\\ngood nursing care, providing both physical and emotion-\\nal support for a person who is gradually able to do less\\nand less for himself, and whose behavior is becoming\\nmore and more erratic. Modifications of the home to\\nincrease safety and security are often necessary. The\\ncaregiver also needs support to prevent anger, despair,\\nand burnout from becoming overwhelming. Becoming\\nfamiliar with the issues likely to lie ahead, and consider-\\ning the appropriate financial and legal issues early on,\\ncan help both the patient and family cope with the diffi-\\ncult process of the disease. Regular medical care by a\\npractitioner with a non-defeatist attitude toward AD is\\nimportant so that illnesses such as urinary or respiratory\\ninfections can be diagnosed and treated properly, rather\\nthan being incorrectly attributed to the inevitable decline\\nseen in AD.\\nPeople with AD are also often depressed or anxious,\\nand may suffer from sleeplessness, poor nutrition , and\\ngeneral poor health. Each of these conditions is treatable\\nto some degree. It is important for the person with AD to\\neat well and continue to exercise. Professional advice\\nfrom a nutritionist may be useful to provide healthy,\\neasy-to-prepare meals. Finger foods may be preferable to\\nthose requiring utensils to be eaten. Regular exercise\\n(supervised if necessary for safety) promotes overall\\nhealth.

Tacrine has been shown to be effective for improv-\\ning memory skills, but only in patients with mild-to-mod-\\nerate AD, and even then in less than half of those who take\\nit. Its beneficial effects are usually mild and temporary, but\\nit may delay the need for nursing home admission. The\\nmost significant side effect is an increase in a liver enzyme\\nknown as alanine aminotransferase, or ALT. Patients tak-\\ning tacrine must have a weekly blood test to monitor their\\nALT levels. Other frequent side effects include nausea,\\nvomiting,diarrhea, abdominal pain, indigestion, and\\nskin rash. The cost of tacrine was about $125 per month in\\nearly 1998, with additional costs for the weekly blood\\nmonitoring. Despite its high cost, tacrine appears to be\\ncost-effective for those who respond to it, since it may\\ndecrease the number of months a patient needs nursing\\ncare. Donepezil is the drug most commonly used to treat\\nmild to moderate symptoms of AD, although it only helps\\nsome patients for periods of time ranging from months to\\nabout two years. Donepezil has two advantages over\\ntacrine: it has fewer side effects, and it can be given once\\ndaily rather than three times daily. Donepezil does not\\nappear to affect liver enzymes, and therefore does not\\nrequire weekly blood tests. The frequency of abdominal\\nside effects is also lower. The monthly cost is approxi-\\nmately the same. Rivastigmine, approved for use in April\\nof 2000, has been shown to improve the ability of patients\\nto carry out daily activities, such as eating and dressing,\\ndecrease behavioral symptoms such as delusions and agi-\\ntation, and improve cognitive functions such as thinking,\\nmemory, and speaking. The cost is similar to those of the\\nother two drugs.

Several preliminary studies have shown that\\nwomen taking estrogen have lower rates of AD, and those\\nwho develop AD have a slower progression and less\\nsevere symptoms.However, estrogen does not appear to\\nhave a beneficial effect on women who already have AD.\\nPreliminary studies have also suggested a reduced\\nrisk for developing AD in older people who regularly use\\nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), includ-\\ning aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen, although not aceta-\\nminophen.Inflammation of the brain is a distinctive char-\\nacteristic of AD, but whether it is a cause or an effect of\\nthe disease is not yet known.\\nAntioxidants, which act to inhibit and protect\\nagainst oxidative damage caused by free radicals, have\\nbeen shown to inhibit toxic effects of beta-amyloid in tis-\\nsue culture. Therefore, research is being conducted to see\\nwhether antioxidants may delay or prevent AD.\\nAnother antioxidant, vitamin E, is also thought to\\ndelay AD onset. It is not yet clear whether this is due to\\nthe specific action of vitamin E on brain cells, or to an\\nincrease in the overall health of those taking it.\\nDrugs such as antidepressants, anti-psychotics, and\\nsedatives are used to treat the behavioral symptoms\\n(agitation, aggression, wandering, and sleep disorders )\\nof AD. Research is being conducted to search for better\\ntreatments, including non-drug approaches for AD\\npatients.\\nNursing care and safety\\nThe person with Alzheimer’s disease will gradually\\nlose the ability to dress, groom, feed, bathe, or use the\\ntoilet by himself; in the later stages of the disease, he\\nmay be unable to move or speak. In addition, the per-\\nson’s behavior becomes increasing erratic. A tendency to\\nwander may make it difficult to leave him unattended for\\neven a few minutes and make even the home a potentially\\ndangerous place. In addition, some patients may exhibit\\ninappropriate sexual behaviors.\\nThe nursing care required for a person with AD is\\nwell within the abilities of most people to learn. The dif-\\nficulty for many caregivers comes in the constant but\\nunpredictable nature of the demands put on them. In\\naddition, the personality changes undergone by a person\\nwith AD can be heartbreaking for family members, as a\\nloved one deteriorates, seeming to become a different\\nperson. Not all AD patients develop negative behaviors:\\nsome become quite gentle, and spend increasing amounts\\nof time in dreamlike states.\\nA loss of good grooming may be one of the early\\nsymptoms of AD. Mismatched clothing, unkempt hair,\\nand decreased interest in personal hygiene become more\\ncommon.

Amblyopia is\\nthe most common cause of impaired vision in children,\\naffecting nearly three out of every 100 people or 2-4%\\nof the population. Vision is a combination of the clarity\\nof the images of the eyes (visual acuity) and the process-\\ning of those images by the brain. If the images produced\\nby the two eyes are substantially different, the brain may\\nnot be able to fuse the images. Instead of seeing two dif-\\nferent images or double vision (diplopia), the brain sup-\\npresses the blurrier image. This suppression can lead to\\namblyopia. During the first few years of life, preferring\\none eye over the other may lead to poor visual develop-\\nment in the blurrier eye.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nSome of the major causes of amblyopia are as follows:\\n• Strabismus. A misalignment of the eyes (strabismus) is\\nthe most common cause of functional amblyopia. The\\ntwo eyes are looking in two different directions at the\\nsame time. The brain is sent two different images and\\nthis causes confusion. Images from the misaligned or\\n“crossed” eye are turned off to avoid double vision.\\n• Anisometropia. This is another type of functional\\namblyopia. In this case, there is a difference of refrac-\\ntive states between the two eyes (in other words, a dif-\\nference of prescriptions between the two eyes). For\\nexample, one eye may be more nearsighted than the\\nother eye, or one eye may be farsighted and the other\\neye nearsighted. Because the brain cannot fuse the two\\ndissimilar images, the brain will suppress the blurrier\\nimage, causing the eye to become amblyopic.\\n• Cataract. Clouding of the lens of the eye will cause the\\nimage to be blurrier than the other eye. The brain\\n“prefers” the clearer image. The eye with the cataract\\nmay become amblyopic.\\n• Ptosis. This is the drooping of the upper eyelid. If light\\ncannot enter the eye because of the drooping lid, the\\neye is essentially not being used. This can lead to\\namblyopia.\\n• Nutrition. A type of organic amblyopia in which nutri-\\ntional deficiencies or chemical toxicity may result in\\namblyopia. Alcohol, tobacco, or a deficiency in the B\\nvitaminsmay result in toxic amblyopia.\\n• Heredity. Amblyopia can run in families.\\nBarring the presence of strabismus or ptosis, chil-\\ndren may or may not show signs of amblyopia. Children\\nmay hold their heads at an angle while trying to favor the\\neye with normal vision. They may have trouble seeing or\\nreaching for things when approached from the side of the\\namblyopic eye.

If an infant’s\\ngood eye is covered, the child may cry.\\nDiagnosis\\nBecause children with outwardly normal eyes may\\nhave amblyopia, it is important to have regular vision\\nscreenings performed for all children. While there is\\nsome controversy regarding the age children should have\\ntheir first vision examination, their eyes can, in actuality,\\nbe examined at any age, even at one day of life.\\nSome recommend that children have their vision\\nchecked by their pediatrician, family physician, ophthal-\\nmologist, or optometrist at or before six months of age.\\nOthers recommend testing by at least the child’s fourth\\nbirthday. There may be a “critical period” in the develop-\\nment of vision, and amblyopia may not be treatable after\\nage eight or nine. The earlier amblyopia is found, the better\\nthe possible outcome. Most physicians test vision as part of\\na child’s medical examination. If there is any sign of an eye\\nproblem, they may refer a child to an eye specialist.\\nThere are objective methods, such as retinoscopy, to\\nmeasure the refractive status of the eyes. This can help\\ndetermine anisometropia. In retinoscopy, a hand-held\\ninstrument is used to shine a light in the child’s (or\\ninfant’s) eyes. Using hand-held lenses, a rough prescrip-\\ntion can be obtained. Visual acuity can be determined\\nusing a variety of methods. Many different eye charts are\\navailable (e.g., tumbling E, pictures, or letters).

An exami-\\nnation of the eyes and visual system is very important\\nwhen there is an unexplained decrease in vision.\\nTreatment\\nThe primary treatment for amblyopia is occlusion\\ntherapy. It is important to alternate patching the good eye\\n(forcing the amblyopic eye to work) and the amblyopic\\neye. If the good eye is constantly patched, it too may\\nbecome amblyopic because of disuse. The treatment plan\\nshould be discussed with the doctor to fully understand\\nhow long the patch will be on. When patched, eye exercis-\\nes may be prescribed to force the amblyopic eye to focus\\nand work. This is called vision therapy or vision training\\n(eye exercises). Even after vision has been restored in the\\nweak eye, part-time patching may be required over a peri-\\nod of years to maintain the improvement.\\nWhile patching is necessary to get the amblyopic\\neye to work, it is just as important to correct the reason\\nfor the amblyopia. Glasses may also be worn if there are\\nerrors in refraction. Surgery or vision training may be\\nnecessary in the case of strabismus. Better nutrition is\\nindicated in some toxic amblyopias. Occasionally,\\namblyopia is treated by blurring the vision in the good\\neye with eye drops or lenses to force the child to use the\\namblyopic eye.\\nPrognosis\\nThe younger the person, the better the chance for\\nimprovement with occlusion and vision therapy. Howev-\\ner, treatment may be successful in older children—even\\nadults. Success in the treatment of amblyopia also\\ndepends upon how severe the amblyopia is, the specific\\ntype of amblyopia, and patient compliance. It is impor-\\ntant to diagnose and treat amblyopia early because sig-\\nnificant vision loss can occur if left untreated. The best\\noutcomes result from early diagnosis and treatment.\\nPrevention\\nTo protect their child’s vision, parents must be aware\\nof amblyopia as a potential problem. This awareness may\\nencourage parents to take young children for vision exams\\nearly on in life—certainly before school age.

Persons with amebiasis may experi-\\nence a wide range of symptoms, including diarrhea ,\\nfever, and cramps. The disease may also affect the\\nintestines, liver, or other parts of the body.\\nDescription\\nAmebiasis, also known as amebic dysentery, is one\\nof the most common parasitic diseases occurring in\\nhumans, with an estimated 500 million new cases each\\nyear. It occurs most frequently in tropical and subtropical\\nareas where living conditions are crowded, with inade-\\nquate sanitation. Although most cases of amebiasis occur\\nin persons who carry the disease but do not exhibit any\\nsymptoms (asymptomatic), as many as 100,000 people\\ndie of amebiasis each year. In the United States, between\\n1 and 5% of the general population will develop amebia-\\nsis in any given year, while male homosexuals, migrant\\nworkers, institutionalized people, and recent immigrants\\ndevelop amebiasis at a higher rate.\\nHuman beings are the only known host of the amebi-\\nasis organism, and all groups of people, regardless of age\\nor sex, can become affected. Amebiasis is primarily\\nspread in food and water that has been contaminated by\\nhuman feces but is also spread by person-to-person con-\\ntact. The number of cases is typically limited, but region-\\nal outbreaks can occur in areas where human feces are\\nused as fertilizer for crops, or in cities with water sup-\\nplies contaminated with human feces.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nRecently, it has been discovered that persons with\\nsymptom-causing amebiasis are infected with Entamoe-\\nba histolytica , and those individuals who exhibit no\\nsymptoms are actually infected with an almost identical-\\nlooking ameba called Entamoeba dispar . During their\\nlife cycles, the amebas exist in two very different forms:\\nthe infective cyst or capsuled form, which cannot move\\nbut can survive outside the human body because of its\\nprotective covering, and the disease-producing form, the\\ntrophozoite, which although capable of moving, cannot\\nsurvive once excreted in the feces and, therefore, cannot\\ninfect others. The disease is most commonly transmitted\\nwhen a person eats food or drinks water containing E.\\nhistolytica cysts from human feces. In the digestive tract\\nthe cysts are transported to the intestine where the walls\\nof the cysts are broken open by digestive secretions,\\nreleasing the mobile trophozoites. Once released within\\nthe intestine, the trophozoites multiply by feeding on\\nintestinal bacteria or by invading the lining of the large\\nintestine. Within the lining of the large intestine, the\\ntrophozoites secrete a substance that destroys intestinal\\ntissue and creates a distinctive bottle-shaped sore (ulcer).\\nThe trophozoites may remain inside the intestine, in the\\nintestinal wall, or may break through the intestinal wall\\nand be carried by the blood to the liver, lungs, brain, or\\nother organs. Trophozoites that remain in the intestines\\neventually form new cysts that are carried through the\\ndigestive tract and excreted in the feces. Under favorable\\ntemperature and humidity conditions, the cysts can sur-\\nvive in soil or water for weeks to months, ready to begin\\nthe cycle again.\\nAlthough 90% of cases of amebiasis in the United\\nStates are mild, pregnant women, children under two\\nyears of age, the elderly, malnourished individuals, and\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 143\\nAmebiasis\\nA micrograph of Entameoba histolytica, a parasitic amoeba\\nwhich invades and destroys the tissues of the intestines,\\ncausing amebiasis and ulceration to the intestinal wall.\\n(Photo Researchers, Inc.

Most persons with\\namebiasis have no noticeable symptoms. Even though\\nthese individuals may not feel ill, they are still capable of\\ninfecting others by person-to-person contact or by conta-\\nminating food or water with cysts that others may ingest,\\nfor example, by preparing food with unwashed hands.\\nCHRONIC NON-DYSENTERIC INFECTION. Individu-\\nals may experience symptoms over a long period of time\\nduring a chronic amebiasis infection and experience\\nrecurrent episodes of diarrhea that last from one to four\\nweeks and recur over a period of years. These patients\\nmay also suffer from abdominal cramps,fatigue , and\\nweight loss.\\nAMEBIC DYSENTERY. In severe cases of intestinal\\namebiasis, the organism invades the lining of the intes-\\ntine, producing sores (ulcers), bloody diarrhea, severe\\nabdominal cramps, vomiting, chills, and fevers as high as\\n104-105°F (40-40.6°C). In addition, a case of acute ame-\\nbic dysentery may cause complications, including\\ninflammation of the appendix (appendicitis ), a tear in\\nthe intestinal wall (perforation), or a sudden, severe\\ninflammation of the colon (fulminating colitis).\\nAMEBOMA. An ameboma is a mass of tissue in the\\nbowel that is formed by the amebiasis organism. It can\\nresult from either chronic intestinal infection or acute\\namebic dysentery. Amebomas may produce symptoms\\nthat mimic cancer or other intestinal diseases.\\nPERIANAL ULCERS. Intestinal amebiasis may pro-\\nduce skin infections in the area around the patient’s anus\\n(perianal). These ulcerated areas have a “punched-out”\\nappearance and are painful to the touch.\\nExtraintestinal amebiasis\\nExtraintestinal amebiasis accounts for approximate-\\nly 10% of all reported amebiasis cases and includes all\\nforms of the disease that affect other organs.\\nThe most common form of extraintestinal amebiasis\\nis amebic abscess of the liver. In the United States, ame-\\nbic liver abscesses occur most frequently in young His-\\npanic adults. An amebic liver abscess can result from\\ndirect infection of the liver by E. histolytica or as a com-\\nplication of intestinal amebiasis. Patients with an amebic\\nabscess of the liver complain of pain in the chest or\\nabdomen, fever, nausea, and tenderness on the right side\\ndirectly above the liver.\\nOther forms of extraintestinal amebiasis, though\\nrare, include infections of the lungs, chest cavity, brain,\\nor genitals. These are extremely serious and have a rela-\\ntively high mortality rate.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of amebiasis is complicated, partly\\nbecause the disease can affect several areas of the body\\nand can range from exhibiting few, if any, symptoms to\\nbeing severe, or even life-threatening. In most cases, a\\nphysician will consider a diagnosis of amebiasis when a\\npatient has a combination of symptoms, in particular,\\ndiarrhea and a possible history of recent exposure to\\namebiasis through travel, contact with infected persons,\\nor anal intercourse.\\nIt is vital to distinguish between amebiasis and\\nanother disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that\\nproduces similar symptoms because, if diagnosed incor-\\nrectly, drugs that are given to treat IBD can encourage the\\ngrowth and spread of the amebiasis organism. Because of\\nthe serious consequences of misdiagnosis, potential cases\\nof IBD must be confirmed with multiple stool samples\\nand blood tests, and a procedure involving a visual\\ninspection of the intestinal wall using a thin lighted, tubu-\\nlar instrument (sigmoidoscopy) to rule out amebiasis.\\nA diagnosis of amebiasis may be confirmed by one\\nor more tests, depending on the location of the disease.\\nStool examination\\nThis test involves microscopically examining a stool\\nsample for the presence of cysts and/or trophozoites of E.\\nhistolytica and not one of the many other intestinal ame-\\nbas that are often found but that do not cause disease. A\\nseries of three stool tests is approximately 90% accurate\\nin confirming a diagnosis of amebic dysentery. Unfortu-\\nnately, however, the stool test is not useful in diagnosing\\namebomas or extraintestinal infections.\\nSigmoidoscopy\\nSigmoidoscopy is a useful diagnostic procedure in\\nwhich a thin, flexible, lighted instrument, called a sig-\\nmoidoscope, is used to visually examine the lower part of\\nthe large intestine for amebic ulcers and take tissue or\\nfluid samples from the intestinal lining.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2144\\nAmebiasis\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 144'),\n",

Blood serum will usually test positive for antibody\\nwithin a week of symptom onset. Blood testing, however,\\ncannot always distinguish between a current or past infec-\\ntion since the antibodies may be detectable in the blood for\\nas long as 10 years following initial infection.\\nImaging studies\\nA number of sophisticated imaging techniques, such\\nas computed tomography scans (CT), magnetic reso-\\nnance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound, can be used to\\ndetermine whether a liver abscess is present. Once locat-\\ned, a physician may then use a fine needle to withdraw a\\nsample of tissue to determine whether the abscess is\\nindeed caused by an amebic infection.\\nTreatment\\nAsymptomatic or mild cases of amebiasis may\\nrequire no treatment. However, because of the potential\\nfor disease spread, amebiasis is generally treated with a\\nmedication to kill the disease-causing amebas. More\\nsevere cases of amebic dysentery are additionally treated\\nby replacing lost fluid and blood. Patients with an ame-\\nbic liver abscess will also require hospitalization and bed\\nrest. For those cases of extraintestinal amebiasis, treat-\\nment can be complicated because different drugs may be\\nrequired to eliminate the parasite, based on the location\\nof the infection within the body. Drugs used to treat ame-\\nbiasis, called amebicides, are divided into two categories:\\nLuminal amebicides\\nThese drugs get their name because they act on\\norganisms within the inner cavity (lumen) of the bowel.\\nThey include diloxanide furoate, iodoquinol, metronida-\\nzole, and paromomycin.\\nTissue amebicides\\nTissue amebicides are used to treat infections in the\\nliver and other body tissues and include emetine, dehy-\\ndroemetine, metronidazole, and chloroquine. Because\\nthese drugs have potentially serious side effects, patients\\ngiven emetine or dehydroemetine require bed rest and\\nheart monitoring. Chloroquine has been found to be the\\nmost useful drug for treating amebic liver abscess.\\nPatients taking metronidazole must avoid alcohol\\nbecause the drug-alcohol combination causes nausea,\\nvomiting, and headache.\\nKEY TERMS\\nAmeboma—A mass of tissue that can develop on\\nthe wall of the colon in response to amebic infec-\\ntion.\\nAntibody —A specific protein produced by the\\nimmune system in response to a specific foreign\\nprotein or particle called an antigen.\\nAppendicitis —Condition characterized by the\\nrapid inflammation of the appendix, a part of the\\nintestine.\\nAsymptomatic—Persons who carry a disease and\\nare usually capable of transmitting the disease but\\nwho do not exhibit symptoms of the disease are\\nsaid to be asymptomatic.\\nDysentery —Intestinal infection marked by diar-\\nrhea containing blood and mucus.\\nFulminating colitis—A potentially fatal complica-\\ntion of amebic dysentery marked by sudden and\\nsevere inflammation of the intestinal lining, severe\\nbleeding or hemorrhaging, and massive shedding\\nof dead tissue.\\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) —Disease in\\nwhich the lining of the intestine becomes inflamed.\\nLumen—The inner cavity or canal of a tube-\\nshaped organ, such as the bowel.\\nProtozoan—A single-celled, usually microscopic\\norganism that is eukaryotic and, therefore, differ-\\nent from bacteria (prokaryotic).\\nMost patients are given a combination of luminal and\\ntissue amebicides over a treatment period of seven to ten\\ndays.

Primary amenorrhea is the failure to start having a\\nperiod by the age of 16. Secondary amenorrhea is more\\ncommon and refers to either the temporary or permanent\\nending of periods in a woman who has menstruated nor-\\nmally in the past. Many women miss a period occasional-\\nly. Amenorrhea occurs if a woman misses three or more\\nperiods in a row.\\nDescription\\nThe absence of menstrual periods is a symptom, not\\na disease. While the average age that menstruation begins\\nis 12, the range varies. The incidence of primary amenor-\\nrhea in the United States is just 2.5%.\\nSome female athletes who participate in rowing,\\nlong distance running, and cycling, may notice a few\\nmissed periods. Women athletes at a particular risk for\\ndeveloping amenorrhea include ballerinas and gymnasts,\\nwho typically exercise strenuously and eat poorly.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAmenorrhea can have many causes. Primary amenor-\\nrhea can be the result of hormonal imbalances, psychi-\\natric disorders, eating disorders,malnutrition, excessive\\nthinness or fatness, rapid weight loss, body fat content too\\nlow, and excessive physical conditioning. Intense physical\\ntraining prior to puberty can delay menarche (the onset\\nof menstruation). Every year of training can delay menar-\\nche for up to five months. Some medications such as anti-\\ndepressants, tranquilizers, steroids, and heroin can induce\\namenorrhea.\\nPrimary amenorrhea\\nHowever, the main cause is a delay in the beginning\\nof puberty either from natural reasons (such as heredity or\\npoor nutrition) or because of a problem in the endocrine\\nsystem, such as a pituitary tumor or hypothyroidism. An\\nobstructed flow tract or inflammation in the uterus may\\nbe the presenting indications of an underlying metabolic,\\nendocrine, congenital or gynecological disorder.\\nTypical causes of primary amenorrhea include:\\n• excessive physical activity\\n• drastic weight loss (such as occurs in anorexia or\\nbulimia)\\n• extreme obesity\\n• drugs (antidepressants or tranquilizers)\\n• chronic illness\\n• turner’s syndrome.

In adolescents,pregnancy and\\nstress are two major causes. Missed periods are usually\\ncaused in adolescents by stress and changes in environ-\\nment. Adolescents are especially prone to irregular peri-\\nods with fevers, weight loss, changes in environment, or\\nincreased physical or athletic activity. However, any ces-\\nsation of periods for four months should be evaluated.\\nThe most common cause of seconardy amenorrhea is\\npregnancy. Also, a woman’s periods may halt temporarily\\nafter she stops taking birth control pills. This temporary\\nhalt usually lasts only for a month or two, though in some\\ncases it can last for a year or more. Secondary amenor-\\nrhea may also be related to hormonal problems related to\\nstress, depression,anorexia nervosa or drugs, or it may\\nbe caused by any condition affecting the ovaries, such as a\\ntumor. The cessation of menstruation also occurs perma-\\nnently after menopause or a hysterectomy.\\nPolycystic ovary syndromeis another common cause\\nof secondary amenorrhea. It is caused by ovaries contain-\\ning many fluid filled sacs (cysts) with abnormal levels of\\nmale hormones (androgens). This condition is related to\\nimproper functioning of the pituitary gland, as it releases\\nhormones necessary for pregnancy (leuteinizing hor-\\nmones), and can cause women to develop male characteris-\\ntics, such as acne and coarse body hair. If the condition is\\nnot treated, some of the androgens may convert to estrogen,\\nand chronically high levels of estrogen may increase the\\nchance of developing cancer of the uterine lining.\\nDiagnosis\\nIt may be difficult to find the cause of amenorrhea,\\nbut the exam should start with a pregnancy test; pregnan-\\ncy needs to be ruled out whenever a woman’s period is\\ntwo to three weeks overdue. Androgen excess, estrogen\\ndeficiency, or other problems with the endocrine system\\nneed to be checked. Prolactin in the blood and the thy-\\nroid stimulating hormone (TSH) should also be checked.\\nThe diagnosis usually includes a patient history and\\na physical exam (including a pelvic exam ). If a woman\\nhas missed three or more periods in a row, a physician\\nmay recommend blood tests to measure hormone levels,\\na scan of the skull to rule out the possibility of a pituitary\\ntumor, and ultrasound scans of the abdomen and pelvis to\\nrule out a tumor of the adrenal gland or ovary.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of amenorrhea depends on the cause. Pri-\\nmary amenorrhea often requires no treatment, but it’s\\nalways important to discover the cause of the problem in\\nany case. Not all conditions can be treated, but any\\nunderlying condition that is treatable should be treated.\\nIf a hormonal imbalance is the problem, proges-\\nterone for one to two weeks every month or two may cor-\\nrect the problem. With polycystic ovary syndrome, birth\\ncontrol pills are often prescribed. A pituitary tumor is\\ntreated with bromocriptine, a drug that reduces certain\\nhormone (prolactin) secretions. Weight loss may bring\\non a period in an obese woman. Easing up on excessive\\nexercise and eating a proper diet may bring on periods in\\nteen athletes. In very rare cases, surgery may be needed\\nfor women with ovarian or uterine cysts.\\nPrognosis\\nProlonged amenorrhea can lead to infertilityand other\\nmedical problems such as osteoporosis (thinning of the\\nbones). If the halt in the normal period is caused by stress\\nor illness, periods should begin again when the stress pass-\\nes or the illness is treated. Amenorrhea that occurs with dis-\\ncontinuing birth control pills usually go away within six to\\neight weeks, although it may take up to a year.\\nThe prognosis for polycystic ovary disease depends\\non the severity of the symptoms and the treatment plan.\\nSpironolactone, a drug that blocks the production of\\nmale hormones, can help in reducing body hair. If a\\nwoman wishes to become pregnant, treatment with\\nclomiphene may be required or, on rare occasions,\\nsurgery on the ovaries.\\nPrevention\\nPrimary amenorrhea caused by a congenital condi-\\ntion cannot be prevented.

Tests are most com-\\nmonly done on newborns. Two tests are available, one\\nusing a blood sample and the other a urine sample.\\nPurpose\\nAmino acid disorder screening is done in newborns,\\nand sometimes children and adults, to detect inborn\\nerrors in metabolism of amino acids.

Of these 20 amino acids, ten are not made by\\nthe body and must be acquired through diet. Congenital\\n(present at birth) enzyme deficiencies that affect amino\\nacid metabolism or congenital abnormalities in the\\namino acid transport system of the kidneys creates a con-\\ndition called aminoaciduria.\\nScreening is especially important in newborns.\\nSome congenital amino acid metabolic defects cause\\nmental retardationthat can prevented with prompt\\ntreatment of the newborn. One of the best known exam-\\nples of this is phenylketonuria (PKU). This is an genetic\\nerror in metabolism of phenylalanine, an amino acid\\nfound in milk. Individuals with PKU do not produce the\\nenzyme necessary to break down phenylalanine.\\nPKU occurs in about one out of 16,000 live births in\\nthe United States, but is more prevalent in caucasians and\\nless prevalent in Ashkenazi Jews and African Americans.\\nNewborns in the United States are routinely screened for\\nPKU by a blood test.\\nThere are two types of aminoacidurias. Primary or\\noverflow aminoaciduria results from deficiencies in the\\nenzymes necessary to metabolize amino acids. Overflow\\naminoaciduria is best detected by a blood plasma test.\\nSecondary or renal aminoaciduria occurs because of\\na congenital defect in the amino acid transport system in\\nthe tubules of the kidneys. This produces increased\\namino acids in the urine. Blood and urine test in combi-\\nnation are used to determine if the aminoaciduria is of\\nthe overflow or renal type. Urine tests are also used to\\nmonitor specific amino acid disorders.\\nNewborns are screened for amino acid disorders.\\nYoung children with acidosis (accumulation of acid in\\nthe body), severe vomiting and diarrhea , or urine with\\nan abnormal color or odor, are also screened with a urine\\ntest for specific amino acid levels.\\nPrecautions\\nBoth blood and urine tests are simple tests that can\\nbe done in a doctor’s office or clinic. These tests can be\\ndone on even the youngest patients.\\nDescription\\nTwo types of amino acid screening tests are used\\ntogether to diagnose amino acid disorders.\\nBlood plasma screening\\nIn the blood test, a medical technician draws a small\\namount of blood from a baby’s heel.

All of these\\ndrugs have the same basic chemical structure.\\nPurpose\\nAminoglycosides are primarily used to combat infec-\\ntions due to aerobic, Gram-negative bacteria. These bacte-\\nria can be identified by their reaction to Gram’s stain. In\\nGram’s staining, a film of material containing the possible\\nbacteria is placed on a glass slide and dried. The slide is\\nstained with crystal violet for one minute, cleaned off with\\nwater and then placed into a solution of Gram’s iodine\\nsolution for one minute. The iodine solution is rinsed off\\nand the slide is immersed in 95% ethyl alcohol. The slide is\\nthen stained again with reddish carbolfuchsin or safranine\\nfor 30 seconds, rinsed in water, dried and examined. Gram-\\npositive bacteria retain the violet purple stain. Gram-nega-\\ntive bacteria accept the red stain. Bacteria that can success-\\nfully be combated with aminoglycosides include\\nPseudomonas, Acinetobacter, and Enterobacter species,\\namong others. Aminoglycosides are also effective against\\nmycobacteria, the bacteria responsible for tuberculosis.\\nThe aminoglycosides can be used against certain\\nGram-positive bacteria, but are not typically employed\\nbecause other antibiotics are more effective and have\\nfewer side effects. Aminoglycosides are ineffective\\nagainst anaerobic bacteria (bacteria that cannot grow in\\nthe presence of oxygen), viruses, and fungi. And only\\none aminoglycoside, paromomycin, is used against para-\\nsitic infection.\\nLike all other antibiotics, aminoglycosides are not\\neffective against influenza , the common cold , or other\\nviral infections.\\nPrecautions\\nPre-existing medical conditions—such as kidney dis-\\nease, eighth cranial nerve disease,myasthenia gravis, and\\nParkinson’s disease—should be discussed prior to taking\\nany aminoglycosides. Pregnant women are usually advised\\nagainst taking aminoglycosides, because their infants may\\nsuffer damage to their hearing, kidneys, or sense of bal-\\nance. However, those factors need to be considered along-\\nside the threat to the mother’s health and life in cases of\\nserious infection. Aminoglycosides do not pass into breast\\nmilk to any great extent, so nursing mothers may be pre-\\nscribed aminoglycosides without injuring their infants.\\nDescription\\nStreptomycin, the first aminoglycoside, was isolated\\nfrom Streptomyces griseusin the mid-1940s. This antibiot-\\nic was very effective against tuberculosis. One of the main\\ndrawbacks to streptomycin is its toxicity, especially to cells\\nin the inner and middle ear and the kidney. Furthermore,\\nsome strains of tuberculosis are resistant to treatment with\\nstreptomycin. Therefore, medical researchers have put con-\\nsiderable effort into identifying other antibiotics with strep-\\ntomycin’s efficacy, but without its toxicity.\\nAminoglycosides are absorbed very poorly from the\\ngastrointestinal tract; in fact, aminoglycosides taken oral-\\nly are excreted virtually unchanged and undiminished in\\nquantity. The route of drug administration depends on the\\ntype and location of the infection being treated. The typi-\\ncal routes of administration are by intramuscular (injec-\\ntion into a muscle) or intravenous injection (injection into\\na vein), irrigation, topical skin application, or inhalation.\\nIf the infection being treated involves the central nervous\\nsystem, the drug can be injected into the spinal canal.\\nThe bactericidal ability of aminoglycosides has not\\nbeen fully explained. It is known that the drug attaches to\\na bacterial cell wall and is drawn into the cell via chan-\\nnels made up of the protein, porin. Once inside the cell,\\nthe aminoglycoside attaches to the cell’s ribosomes.\\nRibosomes are the intracellular structures responsible for\\nmanufacturing proteins. This attachment either shuts\\ndown protein production or causes the cell to produce\\nabnormal, ineffective proteins. The bacterial cell cannot\\nsurvive with this impediment.\\nAntibiotic treatment using aminoglycosides may\\npair the drug with a second type of antibiotic, usually a\\nbeta-lactam or vancomycin, administered separately.\\nBeta-lactams disrupt the integrity of the bacteria cell\\nwall, making it more porous. The increased porosity\\nallows more of the aminoglycoside into the bacteria cell.\\nTraditionally, aminoglycosides were administered at\\neven doses given throughout the day. It was thought that\\na steady plasma concentration was necessary to combat\\ninfection. However, this administration schedule is time\\nand labor intensive. Furthermore, administering a single\\ndaily dose can be as effective, or more effective, than\\nseveral doses throughout the day.\\nDosage depends on the patient’s age, weight, gender,\\nand general health. Since the drug is cleared by the kid-\\nneys, it is important to assess any underlying problems\\nwith kidney function. Kidney function is assessed by\\nmeasuring the blood levels of creatinine, a protein nor-\\nmally found in the body. If these levels are high, it is an\\nindication that the kidneys may not be functioning at an\\noptimal rate and dosage will be lowered accordingly.\\nRisks\\nAminoglycosides have been shown to be toxic to cer-\\ntain cells in the ears and in the kidneys.

They may even be aware\\nthat they suffer from a memory disorder.\\nPeople who experience amnesia have been instrumen-\\ntal in helping brain researchers determine how the brain\\nprocesses memory. Until the early 1970s, researchers\\nviewed memory as a single entity. Memory of new experi-\\nences, motor skills, past events, and previous conditioning\\nwere grouped together in one system that relied on a spe-\\ncific area of the brain.\\nIf all memory were stored in the same way, it would\\nbe reasonable to deduce that damage to the specific brain\\narea would cause complete memory loss. However, stud-\\nies of amnesiacs counter that theory. Such research\\ndemonstrates that the brain has multiple systems for pro-\\ncessing, storing, and drawing on memory.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAmnesia has several root causes. Most are traceable\\nto brain injury related to physical trauma, disease, infec-\\ntion, drug and alcohol abuse, or reduced blood flow to\\nthe brain (vascular insufficiency). In Wernicke-Korsakoff\\nsyndrome, for example, damage to the memory centers\\nof the brain results from the use of alcohol or malnutri-\\ntion. Infections that damage brain tissue, including\\nencephalitis and herpes, can also cause amnesia. If the\\namnesia is thought to be of psychological origin, it is\\ntermed psychogenic.\\nThere are at least three general types of amnesia:\\n• Anterograde. This form of amnesia follows brain trau-\\nma and is characterized by the inability to remember\\nnew information. Recent experiences and short-term\\nmemory disappear, but victims can recall events prior\\nto the trauma with clarity.\\n• Retrograde. In some ways, this form of amnesia is the\\nopposite of anterograde amnesia: the victim can recall\\nevents that occurred after a trauma, but cannot remem-\\nber previously familiar information or the events pre-\\nceding the trauma.\\n• Transient global amnesia. This type of amnesia has no\\nconsistently identifiable cause, but researchers have\\nsuggested that migraines or transient ischemic attacks\\nmay be the trigger. (A transient ischemic attack ,\\nsometimes called “a small stroke,” occurs when a\\nblockage in an artery temporarily blocks off blood sup-\\nply to part of the brain.) A victim experiences sudden\\nconfusion and forgetfulness. Attacks can be as brief as\\n30-60 minutes or can last up to 24 hours. In severe\\nattacks, a person is completely disoriented and may\\nexperience retrograde amnesia that extends back sever-\\nal years. While very frightening for the patient, tran-\\nsient global amnesia generally has an excellent progno-\\nsis for recovery.\\nDiagnosis\\nIn diagnosing amnesia and its cause, doctors look at\\nseveral factors. During a physical examination, the doc-\\ntor inquires about recent traumas or illnesses, drug and\\nmedication history, and checks the patient’s general\\nhealth. Psychological exams may be ordered to deter-\\nmine the extent of amnesia and the memory system\\naffected. The doctor may also order imaging tests such as\\nmagnetic resonance imaging(MRI) to reveal whether\\nthe brain has been damaged, and blood work to exclude\\ntreatable metabolic causes or chemical imbalances.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment depends on the root cause of amnesia and\\nis handled on an individual basis.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 167}, page_content='Purpose\\nSince the mid-1970s, amniocentesis has been used\\nroutinely to test for Down syndrome , by far the most\\ncommon, nonhereditary, genetic birth defect, afflicting\\nabout one in every 1,000 babies. By 1997, approximately\\n800 different diagnostic tests were available, most of\\nthem for hereditary genetic disorders such as Tay-Sachs\\ndisease, sickle cell anemia, hemophilia, muscular dys-\\ntrophy and cystic fibrosis.\\nAmniocentesis, often called amnio, is recommended\\nfor women who will be older than 35 on their due-date. It\\nis also recommended for women who have already borne\\nchildren with birth defects, or when either of the parents\\nhas a family history of a birth defect for which a diagnos-\\ntic test is available. Another reason for the procedure is to\\nconfirm indications of Down syndrome and certain other\\ndefects which may have shown up previously during rou-\\ntine maternal blood screening.\\nThe risk of bearing a child with a nonhereditary\\ngenetic defect such as Down syndrome is directly relat-\\ned to a woman’s age—the older the woman, the greater\\nthe risk. Thirty-five is the recommended age to begin\\namnio testing because that is the age at which the risk of\\ncarrying a fetus with such a defect roughly equals the\\nrisk of miscarriage caused by the procedure—about\\none in 200. At age 25, the risk of giving birth to a child\\nwith this type of defect is about one in 1,400; by age 45\\nit increases to about one in 20. Nearly half of all preg-\\nnant women over 35 in the United States undergo\\namniocentesis and many younger women also decide to\\nhave the procedure. Notably, some 75% of all Down\\nsyndrome infants born in the United States each year are\\nto women younger than 35.\\nOne of the most common reasons for performing\\namniocentesis is an abnormal alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)\\ntest. Alpha-fetoprotein is a protein produced by the fetus\\nand present in the mother’s blood. A simple blood\\nscreening, usually conducted around the 15th week of\\npregnancy, can determine the AFP levels in the mother’s\\nblood. Levels that are too high or too low may signal\\npossible fetal defects. Because this test has a high false-\\npositive rate, another test such as amnio is recommended\\nwhenever the AFP levels fall outside the normal range.\\nAmniocentesis is generally performed during the\\n16th week of pregnancy, with results usually available\\nwithin three weeks. It is possible to perform an amnio as\\nearly as the 11th week but this is not usually recommend-\\ned because there appears to be an increased risk of mis-\\ncarriage when done at this time. The advantage of early\\namnio and speedy results lies in the extra time for deci-\\nsion making if a problem is detected. Potential treatment\\nof the fetus can begin earlier. Important, also, is the fact\\nthat elective abortions are safer and less controversial the\\nearlier they are performed.\\nPrecautions\\nAs an invasive surgical procedure, amnio poses a real,\\nalthough small, risk to the health of a fetus. Parents must\\nweigh the potential value of the knowledge gained, or\\nindeed the reassurance that all is well, against the small risk\\nof damaging what is in all probability a normal fetus. The\\nserious emotional and ethical dilemmas that adverse test\\nresults can bring must also be considered. The decision to\\nundergo amnio is always a matter of personal choice.\\nDescription\\nThe word amniocentesis literally means “puncture\\nof the amnion,” the thin-walled sac of fluid in which a\\ndeveloping fetus is suspended during pregnancy. During\\nthe sampling procedure, the obstetrician inserts a very\\nfine needle through the woman’s abdomen into the uterus\\nand amniotic sac and withdraws approximately one\\nounce of amniotic fluid for testing. The relatively pain-\\nless procedure is performed on an outpatient basis, some-\\ntimes using local anesthesia.\\nThe physician uses ultrasound images to guide nee-\\ndle placement and collect the sample, thereby minimiz-\\ning the risk of fetal injury and the need for repeated nee-\\ndle insertions. Once the sample is collected, the woman\\ncan return home after a brief observation period.

It is performed to remove diseased tis-\\nsue or relieve pain.\\nPurpose\\nArms, legs, hands, feet, fingers, and toes can all be\\namputated. Most amputations involve small body parts\\nsuch as a finger, rather than an entire limb. About 65,000\\namputations are performed in the United States each year.\\nAmputation is performed for the following reasons:\\n• to remove tissue that no longer has an adequate blood\\nsupply\\n• to remove malignant tumors\\n• because of severe trauma to the body part\\nThe blood supply to an extremity can be cut off\\nbecause of injury to the blood vessel, hardening of the\\narteries,arterial embolism , impaired circulation as a\\ncomplication of diabetes mellitus, repeated severe infec-\\ntion that leads to gangrene, severe frostbite, Raynaud’s\\ndisease, or Buerger’s disease.\\nMore than 90% of amputations performed in the\\nUnited States are due to circulatory complications of dia-\\nbetes.

Patients with blood clotting disorders are also not\\ngood candidates for amputation.\\nDescription\\nAmputations can be either planned or emergency\\nprocedures. Injury and arterial embolisms are the main\\nreasons for emergency amputations. The operation is\\nperformed under regional or general anesthesia by a gen-\\neral or orthopedic surgeon in a hospital operating room.\\nDetails of the operation vary slightly depending on\\nwhat part is to be removed. The goal of all amputations is\\ntwofold: to remove diseased tissue so that the wound will\\nheal cleanly, and to construct a stump that will allow the\\nattachment of a prosthesis or artificial replacement part.\\nThe surgeon makes an incision around the part to be\\namputated. The part is removed, and the bone is smoothed.\\nA flap is constructed of muscle, connective tissue, and\\nskin to cover the raw end of the bone. The flap is closed\\nover the bone with sutures (surgical stitches) that remain\\nin place for about one month. Often, a rigid dressing or\\ncast is applied that stays in place for about two weeks.\\nPreparation\\nBefore an amputation is performed, extensive testing\\nis done to determine the proper level of amputation. The\\ngoal of the surgeon is to find the place where healing is\\nmost likely to be complete, while allowing the maximum\\namount of limb to remain for effective rehabilitation.\\nThe greater the blood flow through an area, the more\\nlikely healing is to occur. These tests are designed to mea-\\nsure blood flow through the limb. Several or all of them\\ncan be done to help choose the proper level of amputation.\\n• measurement of blood pressure in different parts of the\\nlimb\\n• xenon 133 studies, which use a radiopharmaceutical to\\nmeasure blood flow\\n• oxygen tension measurements in which an oxygen elec-\\ntrode is used to measure oxygen pressure under the skin\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2158\\nAmputation\\nFigure DFigure B\\nFigure A\\nFemur\\nSkin flapExposed\\nmuscle\\nFigure C\\nSciatic\\nnerve\\nAmputation of leg.

The stump is moved often to encourage good\\ncirculation. Physical therapy and rehabilitation are started\\nas soon as possible, usually within 48 hours. Studies have\\nshown that there is a positive relationship between early\\nrehabilitation and effective functioning of the stump and\\nprosthesis. Length of stay in the hospital depends on the\\nseverity of the amputation and the general health of the\\namputee, but ranges from several days to two weeks.\\nRehabilitation is a long, arduous process, especially\\nfor above the knee amputees. Twice daily physical thera-\\npy is not uncommon. In addition, psychological counsel-\\ning is an important part of rehabilitation. Many people\\nfeel a sense of loss and grief when they lose a body part.\\nOthers are bothered by phantom limb syndrome, where\\nthey feel as if the amputated part is still in place. They\\nmay even feel pain in this limb that does not exist. Many\\namputees benefit from joining self-help groups and\\nmeeting others who are also living with amputation.\\nAddressing the emotional aspects of amputation often\\nspeeds the physical rehabilitation process.\\nRisks\\nAmputation is major surgery. All the risks associated\\nwith the administration of anesthesia exist, along with\\nthe possibility of heavy blood loss and the development\\nof blood clots. Infection is of special concern to\\namputees. Infection rates in amputations average 15%. If\\nthe stump becomes infected, it is necessary to remove the\\nprosthesis and sometimes to amputate a second time at a\\nhigher level.\\nFailure of the stump to heal is another major compli-\\ncation.

Enzymes are sub-\\nstances made and used by the body to trigger specific\\nchemical reactions. The primary function of the enzyme\\namylase is to break down starches in food so that they\\ncan be used by the body. Amylase testing is usually done\\nto determine the cause of sudden abdominal pain.\\nPurpose\\nAmylase testing is performed to diagnose a number\\nof diseases that elevate amylase levels. Pancreatitis, for\\nexample, is the most common reason for a high amylase\\nlevel. When the pancreas is inflamed, amylase escapes\\nfrom the pancreas into the blood. Within six to 48 hours\\nafter the pain begins, amylase levels in the blood start to\\nrise. Levels will stay high for several days before gradu-\\nally returning to normal.\\nThere are other causes of increased amylase. An\\nulcer that erodes tissue from the stomach and goes into\\nthe pancreas will cause amylase to spill into the blood.\\nDuring a mumps infection, amylase from the inflamed\\nsalivary glands increases. Amylase is also found in the\\nliver, fallopian tubes, and small intestine; inflammation of\\nthese tissues also increases levels. Gall bladder disease,\\ntumors of the lung or ovaries, alcohol poisoning, ruptured\\naortic aneurysm, and intestinal strangulation or perfora-\\ntion can also cause unusually high amylase levels.\\nPrecautions\\nThis is not a screening test for future pancreatic dis-\\nease.\\nDescription\\nAmylase testing is done on both blood and urine.\\nThe laboratory may use any of several testing methods\\nthat involve mixing the blood or urine sample with a sub-\\nstance with which amylase is known to react. By measur-\\ning the end-product or the reaction time, technicians can\\ncalculate the amount of amylase present in the sample.\\nMore sophisticated methods separately measure the amy-\\nlase made by the pancreas and the amylase made by the\\nsalivary glands.\\nUrine testing is a better long-term monitor of amy-\\nlase levels. The kidneys quickly move extra amylase\\nfrom the blood into the urine. Urine levels rise six to 10\\nhours after blood levels and stay high longer. Urine is\\nusually collected throughout a 2- or 24-hour time period.\\nResults are usually available the same day.\\nPreparation\\nIn most cases, no special preparation is necessary for\\na person undergoing an amylase blood test. Patients taking\\nlonger term urine amylase tests will be given a container\\nand instructions for collecting the urine at home. The urine\\nshould be refrigerated until it is brought to the laboratory.\\nAftercare\\nDiscomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture site\\nor the person may feel dizzy or faint. Pressure to the punc-\\nture site until the bleeding stops reduces bruising. Apply-\\ning warm packs to the puncture site relieves discomfort.\\nNormal results\\nNormal results vary based on the laboratory and the\\nmethod used.\\nAbnormal results\\nEight out of ten persons with acute pancreatitis will\\nhave high amylase levels, up to four times the normal\\nlevel. Other causes of increased amylase, such as\\nmumps, kidney failure,pregnancy occurring in the\\nabdomen but outside the uterus ( ectopic pregnancy ),\\ncertain tumors, a penetrating ulcer, certain complications\\nof diabetes, and advanced pancreatic cancer, are further\\ninvestigated based on the person’s symptoms, medical\\nhistory, and the results of other tests.\\nIn kidney disease, the kidneys are not as efficient at\\nremoving amylase from the blood. Amylase rises in the\\nblood, but stays at normal levels in the urine.\\nPeople with macroamylasia have large clumps of\\namylase in their blood. These clumps are too large to\\nmove through the kidney, so they stay in the blood. Amy-\\nlase levels in the blood will be high; levels in the urine\\nwill be low.\\nAmylase levels may be low in severe liver disease\\n(including hepatitis), conditions in which the pancreas\\nfails to secrete enough enzyme for proper digestions\\n(pancreatic insufficiency), when toxic materials build up\\nin the blood during pregnancy (pre-eclampsia), following\\nburns, in thyroid disorders, and in advanced cystic\\nfibrosis.

Also known as light-chain-related amyloidosis, it\\nmay also occur in association with multiple myeloma\\n(bone marrow cancer).\\nSecondary amyloidosis is a result of chronic infec-\\ntion or inflammatory disease. It is often associated with:\\n• familial Mediterranean fever (a bacterial infection\\ncharacterized by chills, weakness, headache , and\\nrecurring fever)\\n• granulomatous ileitis (inflammation of the small intes-\\ntine)\\n• Hodgkin’s disease (cancer of the lymphatic system)\\n• leprosy\\n• osteomyelitits (bacterial infection of bone and bone\\nmarrow)\\n• rheumatoid arthritis\\nFamilial or hereditary amyloidosis is the only inher-\\nited form of the disease. It occurs in members of most\\nethnic groups, and each family has a distinctive pattern\\nof symptoms and organ involvement. Hereditary amyloi-\\ndosis is though to be autosomal dominant, which means\\nthat only one copy of the defective gene is necessary to\\ncause the disease. A child of a parent with familial amy-\\nloidosis has a 50-50 chance of developing the disease.\\nAmyloidosis can involve any organ or system in the\\nbody. The heart, kidneys, gastrointestinal system, and\\nnervous system are affected most often.

It is also known as\\nmotor neuron disease and Lou Gehrig’s disease, after the\\nbaseball player whose career it ended.\\nDescription\\nALS is a disease of the motor neurons, those nerve\\ncells reaching from the brain to the spinal cord (upper\\nmotor neurons) and the spinal cord to the peripheral\\nnerves (lower motor neurons) that control muscle move-\\nment. In ALS, for unknown reasons, these neurons die,\\nleading to a progressive loss of the ability to move virtual-\\nly any of the muscles in the body. ALS affects “volun-\\ntary” muscles, those controlled by conscious thought,\\nsuch as the arm, leg, and trunk muscles. ALS, in and of\\nitself, does not affect sensation, thought processes, the\\nheart muscle, or the “smooth” muscle of the digestive sys-\\ntem, bladder, and other internal organs. Most people with\\nALS retain function of their eye muscles as well. Howev-\\ner, various forms of ALS may be associated with a loss of\\nintellectual function (dementia) or sensory symptoms.\\n“Amyotrophic” refers to the loss of muscle bulk, a\\ncardinal sign of ALS. “Lateral” indicates one of the\\nregions of the spinal cord affected, and “sclerosis”\\ndescribes the hardened tissue that develops in place of\\nhealthy nerves. ALS affects approximately 30,000 people\\nin the United States, with about 5,000 new cases each\\nyear. It usually begins between the ages of 40 and 70,\\nalthough younger onset is possible. Men are slightly\\nmore likely to develop ALS than women.\\nALS progresses rapidly in most cases. It is fatal\\nwithin three years for 50% of all people affected, and\\nwithin five years for 80%. Ten percent of people with\\nALS live beyond eight years.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nThe symptoms of ALS are caused by the death of\\nmotor neurons in the spinal cord and brain. Normally, these\\nneurons convey electrical messages from the brain to the\\nmuscles to stimulate movement in the arms, legs, trunk,\\nneck, and head. As motor neurons die, the muscles they\\nenervate cannot be moved as effectively, and weakness\\nresults. In addition, lack of stimulation leads to muscle\\nwasting, or loss of bulk. Involvement of the upper motor\\nneurons causes spasms and increased tone in the limbs, and\\nabnormal reflexes. Involvement of the lower motor neurons\\ncauses muscle wasting and twitching (fasciculations).\\nAlthough many causes of motor neuron degenera-\\ntion have been suggested for ALS, none has yet been\\nproven responsible. Results of recent research have\\nimplicated toxic molecular fragments known as free radi-\\ncals. Some evidence suggests that a cascade of events\\nleads to excess free radical production inside motor neu-\\nrons, leading to their death. Why free radicals should be\\nproduced in excess amounts is unclear, as is whether this\\nexcess is the cause or the effect of other degenerative\\nprocesses. Additional agents within this toxic cascade\\nmay include excessive levels of a neurotransmitter\\nknown as glutamate, which may over-stimulate motor\\nneurons, thereby increasing free-radical production, and\\na faulty detoxification enzyme known as SOD-1, for\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 163\\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 163'),\n",

Autoimmune factors\\nor premature aging may play some role, as could viral\\nagents or environmental toxins.\\nTwo major forms of ALS are known: familial and\\nsporadic. Familial ALS accounts for about 10% of all ALS\\ncases. As the name suggests, familial ALS is believed to be\\ncaused by the inheritance of one or more faulty genes.\\nAbout 15% of families with this type of ALS have muta-\\ntions in the gene for SOD-1. SOD-1 gene defects are dom-\\ninant, meaning only one gene copy is needed to develop\\nthe disease. Therefore, a parent with the faulty gene has a\\n50% chance of passing the gene along to a child.\\nSporadic ALS has no known cause.

Leg weakness\\nmay first become apparent by an increased frequency of\\nstumbling on uneven pavement, or an unexplained diffi-\\nculty climbing stairs. Arm weakness may lead to difficul-\\nty grasping and holding a cup, for instance, or loss of\\ndexterity in the fingers.\\nLess often, the earliest sign of ALS is weakness in\\nthe bulbar muscles, those muscles in the mouth and\\nthroat that control chewing, swallowing, and speaking. A\\nperson with bulbar weakness may become hoarse or tired\\nafter speaking at length, or speech may become slurred.\\nIn addition to weakness, the other cardinal signs of\\nALS are muscle wasting and persistent twitching (fascic-\\nulation). These are usually seen after weakness becomes\\nobvious. Fasciculation is quite common in people without\\nthe disease, and is virtually never the first sign of ALS.\\nWhile initial weakness may be limited to one region,\\nALS almost always progresses rapidly to involve virtually\\nall the voluntary muscle groups in the body. Later symp-\\ntoms include loss of the ability to walk, to use the arms and\\nhands, to speak clearly or at all, to swallow, and to hold the\\nhead up. Weakness of the respiratory muscles makes\\nbreathing and coughing difficult, and poor swallowing con-\\ntrol increases the likelihood of inhaling food or saliva (aspi-\\nration). Aspiration increases the likelihood of lung infec-\\ntion, which is often the cause of death. With a ventilator\\nand scrupulous bronchial hygiene, a person with ALS may\\nlive much longer than the average, although weakness and\\nwasting will continue to erode any remaining functional\\nabilities. Most people with ALS continue to retain function\\nof the extraocular muscles that move their eyes, allowing\\nsome communication to take place with simple blinks or\\nthrough use of a computer-assisted device.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of ALS begins with a complete med-\\nical history and physical exam, plus a neurological exam-\\nination to determine the distribution and extent of weak-\\nness. An electrical test of muscle function, called an elec-\\ntromyogram, or EMG, is an important part of the diag-\\nnostic process. Various other tests, including blood and\\nurine tests, x rays, and CT scans, may be done to rule out\\nother possible causes of the symptoms, such as tumors of\\nthe skull base or high cervical spinal cord, thyroid dis-\\nease, spinal arthritis,lead poisoning , or severe vitamin\\ndeficiency.

Two studies published in 1988 suggested that\\namino-acid therapies may provide some improvement\\nfor some people with ALS. While individual reports\\nclaim benefits for megavitamin therapy, herbal medi-\\ncine, and removal of dental fillings, for instance, no evi-\\ndence suggests that these offer any more than a brief\\npsychological boost, often followed by a more severe\\nletdown when it becomes apparent the disease has con-\\ntinued unabated. However, once the causes of ALS are\\nbetter understood, alternative therapies may be more\\nintensively studied. For example, if damage by free radi-\\ncals turns out to be the root of most of the symptoms,\\nantioxidant vitamins and supplements may be used\\nmore routinely to slow the progression of ALS. Or, if\\nenvironmental toxins are implicated, alternative thera-\\npies with the goal of detoxifying the body may be of\\nsome use.\\nPrognosis\\nALS usually progresses rapidly, and leads to death\\nfrom respiratory infection within three to five years in\\nmost cases.

Fleming Fallon, Jr., MD, DrPH\\nAnaerobic infections\\nDefinition\\nAn anaerobic infection is an infection caused by\\nbacteria (called anaerobes) which cannot grow in the\\npresence of oxygen. Anaerobic bacteria can infect deep\\nwounds, deep tissues, and internal organs where there is\\nlittle oxygen. These infections are characterized by\\nabscessformation, foul-smelling pus, and tissue\\ndestruction.\\nDescription\\nAnaerobic means “life without air.” Anaerobic bac-\\nteria grow in places which completely, or almost com-\\npletely, lack oxygen. They are normally found in the\\nmouth, gastrointestinal tract, and vagina, and on the skin.\\nCommonly known diseases caused by anaerobic bacteria\\ninclude gas gangrene, tetanus, and botulism. Nearly all\\ndental infections are caused by anaerobic bacteria.\\nAnaerobic bacteria can cause an infection when a\\nnormal barrier (such as skin, gums, or intestinal wall)\\nis damaged due to surgery, injury, or disease. Usually,\\nthe immune system kills any invading bacteria, but\\nsometimes the bacteria are able to grow and cause an\\ninfection. Body sites that have tissue destruction\\n(necrosis) or a poor blood supply are low in oxygen\\nand favor the growth of anaerobic bacteria. The low\\noxygen condition can result from blood vessel disease,\\nshock, injury, and surgery.\\nAnaerobic bacteria can cause infection practically\\nanywhere in the body. For example:\\n• Mouth, head, and neck. Infections can occur in the root\\ncanals, gums (gingivitis), jaw, tonsils, throat, sinuses,\\nand ears.\\n• Lung. Anaerobic bacteria can cause pneumonia , lung\\nabscesses, infecton of the lining of the lung ( empye-\\nma), and dilated lung bronchi (bronchiectasis).\\n• Intraabdominal. Anaerobic infections within the\\nabdomen include abscess formation, peritonitis , and\\nappendicitis.\\n• Female genital tract. Anaerobic bacteria can cause\\npelvic abscesses, pelvic inflammatory disease ,\\ninflammation of the uterine lining (endometritis), and\\npelvic infections following abortion,childbirth , and\\nsurgery.\\n• Skin and soft tissue. Anaerobic bacteria are common\\ncauses of diabetic skin ulcers, gangrene, destructive\\ninfection of the deep skin and tissues (necrotizing fasci-\\ntis), and bite wound infections.\\n• Central nervous system. Anaerobic bacteria can cause\\nbrain and spinal cord abscesses.\\n• Bloodstream. Anaerobic bacteria can be found in the\\nbloodstream of ill patients (a condition called bac-\\nteremia).\\nCauses and symptoms\\nPeople who have experienced shock, injury, or\\nsurgery, and those with blood vessel disease or tumors\\nare at an increased risk for infection by anaerobic bacte-\\nria. There are many different kinds of anaerobic bacteria\\nwhich can cause an infection. Indeed, most anaerobic\\ninfections are “mixed infections” which means that\\nthere is a mixture of different bacteria growing. The\\nanaerobic bacteria that most frequently cause infections\\nare Bacteroides fragilis , Peptostreptococcus , and\\nClostridium species.\\nThe signs and symptoms of anaerobic infection\\ncan vary depending on the location of the infection.

Symptoms for specific infections are\\nas follows:\\n• Tooth and gum infections. Swollen, tender bleeding\\ngums, bad breath , and pain. Severe infections may\\nproduce oozing sores.\\n• Throat infection. An extremely sore throat, bad breath,\\na bad taste in the mouth, fever, and a sense of choking.\\n• Lung infection. Chest pain, coughing, difficulty breath-\\ning, fever, foul-smelling sputum, and weight loss.\\n• Intraabdominal infection. Pain, fever, and possibly, if fol-\\nlowing surgery, foul- smelling drainage from the wound.\\n• Pelvic infection. Foul-smelling pus or blood draining\\nfrom the uterus, general or localized pelvic pain, fever,\\nand chills.\\n• Skin and soft tissue infection. Infected wounds are red,\\npainful, swollen, and may drain a foul-smelling pus.\\nSkin infection causes localized swelling, pain, redness,\\nand possibly a painful, open sore (ulcer) which drains\\nfoul-smelling pus. Severe skin infections may cause\\nextensive tissue destruction (necrosis).\\n• Bloodstream. Bloodstream invasion causes high fever\\n(up to 105°F [40.6°C]), chills, a general ill feeling, and\\nis potentially fatal.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of anaerobic infection is based pri-\\nmarily on symptoms, the patient’s medical history, and\\nlocation of the infection. A foul-smelling infection or\\ndrainage from an abscess is diagnostic of anaerobic\\ninfection. This foul smell is produced by anaerobic bac-\\nteria and occurs in one third to one half of patients late in\\nthe infection. Other clues to anaerobic infection include\\ntissue necrosis and gas production at the infection site. A\\nsample from the infected site may be obtained, using a\\nswab or a needle and syringe, to determine which bacte-\\nria is (are) causing the infection. Because these bacteria\\ncan be easily killed by oxygen, they rarely grow in the\\nlaboratory cultures of tissue or pus samples.\\nKEY TERMS\\nAbscess—A lump filled with pus resulting from an\\ninfection.\\nAnaerobic—Living and growing in the absence of\\noxygen.\\nNecrosis—Tissue death and destruction resulting\\nfrom infection or disease.\\nThe recent medical history of the patient is helpful\\nin diagnosing anaerobic infection. A patient who has or\\nrecently had surgery, dental work, tumors, blood vessel\\ndisease, or injury are susceptible to this infection. The\\nfailure to improve following treatment with antibiotics\\nthat aren’t able to kill anaerobes is another clue that the\\ninfection is caused by anaerobes. The location and type\\nof infection also help in the diagnosis.\\nDiagnostic tests may include blood tests to see if\\nbacteria are in the bloodstream and x rays to look at\\ninternal infections.\\nTreatment\\nSerious infections may require hospitalization for\\ntreatment. Immediate antibiotic treatment of anaerobic\\ninfections is necessary. Laboratory testing may identify\\nthe bacteria causing the infection and also which antibi-\\notic will work best. Every antibiotic does not work\\nagainst all anaerobic bacteria but nearly all anaerobes are\\nkilled by chloramphenicol (Chloromycetin), metronida-\\nzole (Flagyl or Protostat), and imipenem (Primaxin).\\nOther antibiotics which may be used are clindamycin\\n(Cleocin) or cefoxitin (Mefoxin).\\nSurgical removal or drainage of the abscess is\\nalmost always required. This may involve drainage by\\nneedle and syringe to remove the pus from a skin abscess\\n(called “aspiration”). The area would be numbed prior to\\nthe aspiration procedure. Also, some internal abscesses\\ncan be drained using this procedure with the help of\\nultrasound (a device which uses sound waves to visualize\\ninternal organs). This type of abscess drainage may be\\nperformed in the doctor’s office.\\nPrognosis\\nComplete recovery should be achieved with the\\nappropriate surgery and antibiotic treatment. Untreated\\nor uncontrolled infections can cause severe tissue and\\nbone destruction, which would require plastic surgery to\\nrepair. Serious infections can be life threatening.\\nPrevention\\nAlthough anaerobic infections can occur in anyone,\\ngood hygiene and general health may help to prevent\\ninfections.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nHarrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine.Ed.

It is estimated that overall abnormali-\\nties of the anus and rectum occur in about one in every\\n5,000 births and are slightly more common among boys.\\nA mother who has one child with these kind of condi-\\ntions has a 1% chance of having another child who suf-\\nfers from this ailment.\\nCause and symptoms\\nAnal atresia is a defect in the development of the\\nfetus. The cause is unknown, but genetics seem to play a\\nminor role.\\nDiagnosis\\nUsually a physician can make an obvious visual\\ndiagnosis of anal atesia right after birth. Occasionally,\\nhowever, anal atresia is missed until the baby is fed and\\nsigns of intestinal obstruction appear. At the end of the\\nfirst or second day, the abdomen swells and there is vom-\\niting of fecal material. To determine the type of anal atre-\\nsia and the exact position, x rays will be taken which\\ninclude injecting opaque dye into the opening. Magnetic\\nresonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography\\nscans (CT), as well as ultrasound, are the imaging tech-\\nniques used to determine the type and size of the anal\\natresia. Ultrasound uses sound waves, CT scans pass x\\nrays through the body at different angles, and an MRI\\nuses a magnetic field and radio waves.\\nKEY TERMS\\nAnus—The canal at the end of the large intestine\\nthrough which waste is excreted to the outside of\\nthe body.\\nBowel obstruction—Anything that prevents waste\\nfrom moving normally to the anal opening.\\nColostomy —An operation where the large intes-\\ntine is diverted through an opening in the\\nabdomen and waste is excreted.\\nFeces—Bodily waste material that normally passes\\nthrough the anus.\\nFistula—An abnormal channel that connects two\\norgans or connects an organ to the skin.\\nTreatment\\nSurgery is the only treatment for anal atresia. For\\nhigh anal atresia, immediately after the diagnosis is made,\\na surgical incision is made in the large intestine to make a\\ntemporary opening (colostomy ) in the abdomen where\\nwaste is excreted. Several months later, the intestine is\\nmoved into the ring of muscle (sphincter) that is part of\\nthe anus and a hole is made in the skin. The colostomy is\\nclosed several weeks later. In low anal atresia, immediate-\\nly after diagnosis, a hole is made in the skin to open the\\narea where the anus should be. If the channel is in the\\nwrong place, the intestine is moved into the correct posi-\\ntion sometime during the child’s first year. After surgery,\\nthe pediatric surgeon uses an instrument to dilate or\\nwiden the rectum and teaches the parents how to do this\\ndaily at home to prevent scar tissue from contracting.\\nPrognosis\\nWith high anal atresia, many children have problems\\ncontrolling bowel function.

The anus is the inch-and-a-half-long end\\nportion of the large intestine, which opens to allow solid\\nwastes to exit the body. Other parts of the large intestine\\ninclude the colon and the rectum.\\nDescription\\nDifferent cancers can develop in different parts of\\nthe anus, part of which is inside the body and part of\\nwhich is outside. Sometimes abnormal changes of the\\nanus are harmless in their early stages but may later\\ndevelop into cancer. Some anal warts, for example, con-\\ntain precancerous areas and can develop into cancer.\\nTypes of anal cancer include:\\n• Squamous Cell Carcinomas. Approximately half of\\nanal cancers are squamous cell carcinomas, which arise\\nfrom the cells lining the anal margin and the anal canal.\\nThe anal margin is the part of the anus that is half inside\\nand half outside the body, and the anal canal is the part\\nof the anus that is inside the body. The earliest form of\\nsquamous cell carcinoma is known as carcinoma in\\nsitu, or Bowen’s disease.\\n• Cloacogenic Carcinomas. Approximately one-fourth to\\none-third of anal tumors are cloacogenic carcinomas.\\nThese tumors develop in the transitional zone, or cloa-\\nca, which is a ring of tissue between the anal canal and\\nthe rectum.\\n• Adenocarcinomas. About 15% of anal cancers are ade-\\nnocarcinomas, which affect glands in the anal area. One\\ntype of adenocarcinoma that can occur in the anal area\\nis called Paget’s disease, which can also affect the\\nvulva, breasts, and other areas of the body.\\n• Skin cancers. A small percentage of anal cancers are\\neither basal cell carcinomas, or malignant melanomas,\\ntwo types of skin cancer. Malignant melanomas, which\\ndevelop from skin cells that produce the brown pigment\\ncalled melanin, are far more common on areas of the\\nbody exposed to the sun.\\nApproximately 3,500 Americans will be diagnosed\\nwith anal cancer in 2001, and an estimated 500 individu-\\nals will die of the disease during this same interval,\\naccording to the American Cancer Society. Anal cancers\\nare fairly rare: they make up only 1% to 2% of cancers\\naffecting the digestive system. The disease affects\\nwomen somewhat more often than men, although the\\nnumber of cases among men, particularly homosexual\\nmen, seems to be increasing.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe exact cause of most anal cancers is unknown,\\nalthough certain individuals appear to have a higher risk\\nof developing the disease. Smokers are at higher risk, as\\nare individuals with certain types of the human papillo-\\nmavirus (HPV), and those with long-term problems in\\nthe anal area, such as abnormal openings known as fistu-\\nlas. Since it increases the risk of HPV infection, the prac-\\ntice of anal sex appears to increase the risk of anal\\ncancer—male homosexuals who practice anal sex are\\nabout 33 times more likely to have anal cancers than het-\\nerosexual men. Those with weakened immune systems,\\nsuch individuals with HIV , or transplant patients taking\\nimmunosuppressant drugs, are also at higher risk.\\nMost individuals with anal cancer are over the age of 50.\\nSymptoms of anal cancer resemble those found in\\nother harmless conditions. They include pain, itching\\nand bleeding, straining during a bowel movement,\\nchange in bowel habits, change in the diameter of the\\nstool, discharge from the anus, and swollen lymph nodes\\nin the anal or groin area.\\nDiagnosis\\nAnal cancer is sometimes diagnosed during routine\\nphysicals, or during minor procedures such as hemorrhoid\\nremoval. It may also be diagnosed during a digital rectal\\nexamination (DRE), when a physician inserts a gloved,\\nlubricated finger into the anus to feel for unusual growths.\\nIndividuals over the age of 50 who have no symptoms\\nshould have a digital rectal examination (DRE) every  five\\nto 10 years, according to American Cancer Society (ACS)\\nguidelines for early detection of colorectal cancer.\\nOther diagnostic procedures for anal cancer include:\\nAnoscopy. A procedure that involves use of a special\\ndevice to examine the anus. Proctoscopy. A procedure that\\ninvolves use of a lighted scope to see the anal canal. Tran-\\nsrectal ultrasound. A procedure in which sound waves are\\nused to create an image of the anus and nearby tissues.\\nA biopsy is performed on any suspicious growths;\\nthat is, a tiny piece of the growth is examined under a\\nmicroscope for cancer cells. The physician may also per-\\nform a procedure called a fine needle aspiration biopsy,\\nin which a needle is used to withdraw fluid from lymph\\nnodes located near the growth, to make sure the cancer\\nhasn’t spread to these nodes.\\nAnal cancer severity is categorized by the following\\nstages:\\n• Stage 0 anal cancer is found only in the top layer of\\nanal tissue.\\n• Stage I anal cancer has spread beyond the top layer of\\nanal tissue, but is less than 1 inch in diameter.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2170\\nAnal cancer\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 170'),\n",

A local\\nresection, performed if the cancer has not spread,\\nremoves the tumor and an area of tissue around the tumor.\\nAn abdominoperineal resection is a more complex proce-\\ndure in which the anus and the lower rectum are removed,\\nand an opening called a colostomy is created for body\\nwastes to exit.

It is usually delivered via a machine outside\\nthe body, but may also be delivered via surgically\\nimplanted radioactive pellets. This latter method is called\\ninternal radiation, brachytherapy, or interstitial radiation.\\nSide effects of radiation may include tiredness, skin dam-\\nage resembling sunburn, and damage to anal tissues.\\nChemotherapy fights cancer using drugs, which may\\nbe delivered via pill or needle. Some chemotherapy types\\nkill cancer cells directly, while others act indirectly by\\nmaking cancer cells more vulnerable to radiation. The\\nmain drugs used to treat anal cancer are 5-fluorouracil (5-\\nFU) and mitomycin or 5-FU and cisplatin. Side effects of\\nchemotherapy, which damages normal cells in addition to\\ncancer cells, may include nausea and vomiting , hair\\nloss, loss of appetite, diarrhea, mouth sores, fatigue,\\nshortness of breath, and a weakened immune system.\\nAlternative treatment\\nResearch suggests acupuncture can help manage\\nchemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting and control\\npain associated with surgery.\\nPrognosis\\nAnal cancer is often curable.

They can be yellow, pink, or light\\nbrown in color, and only rarely are painful or uncomfort-\\nable. In fact, infected individuals often are unaware that\\nthey exist. Most cases are caused by sexual transmission.\\nMost individuals have between one to 10 genital\\nwarts thtat range in size from roughly 0.5–1.9 cm\\n2\\n. Some\\nwill complain of painless bumps or itching , but often,\\nthese warts can remain completely unnoticed.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCondyloma acuminatum is one of the most common\\nsexually transmitted disease (STD) in the United States.\\nYoung adults aged 17 to 33 years are at greatest risk.\\nRisk factors include smoking , using oral contracep-\\ntives, having multiple sexual partners, and an early coital\\nage. In addition, individuals who have a history of\\nimmunosuppression or anal intercourse are also at risk.\\nRoughly 90% of all anal warts are caused by the\\nhuman papilloma virus (HPV) types 6 and 11, which are\\nthe least likely of over 60 types of HPV to become can-\\ncerous. Anal warts are usually transmitted through direct\\nsexual contact with someone who is infected with condy-\\nloma acuminata anywhere in the genital area, including\\nthe penis and vagina. Studies have shown that roughly\\n75% of those who engage in sexual contact with some-\\none infected with condyloma acuminata will develop\\nthese warts within three months.\\nTreatment\\nAccording to guidelines from the Centers for Dis-\\nease Control (CDC), the treatment of all genital warts,\\nincluding anal warts, should be conducted according to\\nthe methods preferred by the patient, the medications or\\nprocedures most readily available, and the experience of\\nthe patient’s physician in removing anal warts.\\nTreatment options include electrical cautery, surgi-\\ncal removal, or both. Warts that appear inside the anal\\ncanal will almost always be treated with cauterization or\\nsurgical removal. Surgical removal, also known as exci-\\nsion, has the highest success rates and lowest recurrence\\nrates. Indeed, studies have shown that initial cure rates\\nrange from 63–91%.\\nUnfortunately, most cases require numerous treat-\\nments because the virus that causes the warts can live in\\nthe surrounding tissue. The area may seem normal and\\nwart-free for six months or longer before another wart\\ndevelops.\\nLaser surgery is another possibility, but requires\\nlocal, general, or spinal anesthesia, depending on the\\nnumber warts and where they are.\\nElectrocoagulation, a technique that uses electrical\\nenergy to destroy the warts, is usually the most painful of\\nthe procedures done to eliminate condyloma acuminata\\nof the anus, and is usually reserved for larger warts. It is\\ndone with local anesthesia, and may cause discharge or\\nbleeding from the anus.\\nFollow-up visits to the physician are necessary to\\nmake sure that the warts have not recurred. It is recom-\\nmended that these patients see their physicians every\\nthree to six months for up to 1.5 years, which is how long\\nthe incubation period is for the HPV virus.\\nCarbon dioxide laser treatment and electrodesicca-\\ntion are other options, but these are usually reserved for\\nextensive warts or those that continue to recur despite\\nnumerous treatments. However, because HPV virus can\\nbe transmitted via the smoke caused by these procedures,\\nthey are usually reserved for the worst infections.\\nFor small warts that affect only the skin around the\\nanus, several medications are available, which can be\\napplied directly to the surface of the warts by a physician\\nor by the patients themselves.\\nSuch medications include podophyllum resin\\n(Podocon-25, Pod-Ben-25), a substance made from the\\ncytotoxic extracts of several plants.

It can be applied twice\\ndaily for up to 4 weeks. Podofilox offers a slightly higher\\ncure rate than podophyllin, and can also be used to pre-\\nvent warts.\\nTrichloroacetic and bichloroacetic acids are avail-\\nable in several concentrations up to 80% for the treat-\\nment of condyloma acuminata. These acids work to cau-\\nterize the skin, and are quite caustic. Nevertheless, they\\ncause less irritation and overall body effects than the\\nother agents mentioned above. Recurrence, however, is\\nhigher with these acids.\\nBleomycin (Blenoxane) is another treatment option,\\nbut it has several drawbacks. First, it must be adminis-\\ntered by a physician into each lesion via injection, but is\\ncan have a host of side effects, and patients must be fol-\\nlowed carefully by their physician.\\nImiquimod 5% cream is also available for patients to\\napply themselves. It is to be applied three times weekly,\\nfor up to 16 weeks, and has been shown to clear warts\\nwithin eight to 10 weeks.\\nFinally, the interferon drugs, which are naturally\\noccurring proteins that have antiviral and antitumor\\neffects, are available. These include interferon alfa 2a\\nand 2b (Roferon, Intron A), which are to be injected into\\neach lesion twice a week for up to eight weeks.\\nPrognosis\\nOnce a diagnosis of anal warts has been made, fur-\\nther outbreaks can be controlled or sometimes prevented\\nwith proper care. Unfortunately, many cases of anal warts\\neither fail to respond to treatment or recur. Patients have\\nto undergo roughly six to nine treatments over several\\nmonths to assure that the warts are completely eradicated.\\nRecurrence rates have been estimated to be over 50%\\nafter one year and may be due to the long incubation of\\nHPV (up to 1.5 years), deep lesions, undetected lesions,\\nvirus present in surrounding skin that is not treated.\\nPrevention\\nSexual abstinence and monogamous relationships can\\nbe the most effective form of prevention, and condoms\\nmay also decrease the chances of transmission of condylo-\\nma acuminata.

Other drugs, notably the tricyclic anti-\\ndepressants and anti-epileptic agents such as gabapentin,\\nhave been used to relieve pain, particularly neurologic\\npain, but are not routinely classified as analgesics. Anal-\\ngesics provide symptomatic relief, but have no effect on\\ncausation, although clearly the NSAIDs, by virtue of\\ntheir dual activity, may be beneficial in both regards.\\nDescription\\nPain has been classified as “productive” pain and\\n“non-productive” pain. While this distinction has no\\nphysiologic meaning, it may serve as a guide to treat-\\nment. “Productive” pain has been described as a warning\\nof injury, and so may be both an indication of need for\\ntreatment and a guide to diagnosis. “Non-productive”\\npain by definition serves no purpose either as a warning\\nor diagnostic tool.\\nAlthough pain syndromes may be dissimilar, the\\ncommon factor is a sensory pathway from the affected\\norgan to the brain. Analgesics work at the level of the\\nnerves, either by blocking the signal from the peripheral\\nnervous system, or by distorting the interpretation by the\\ncentral nervous system. Selection of an appropriate anal-\\ngesic is based on consideration of the risk-benefit factors\\nof each class of drugs, based on type of pain, severity of\\npain, and risk of adverse effects. Traditionally, pain has\\nbeen divided into two classes, acute and chronic,\\nalthough severity and projected patient survival are other\\nfactors that must be considered in drug selection.\\nAcute pain\\nAcute pain is self limiting in duration, and includes\\npost-operative pain, pain of injury, and childbirth .\\nBecause pain of these types is expected to be short term,\\nthe long-term side effects of analgesic therapy may rou-\\ntinely be ignored. Thus, these patients may safely be\\ntreated with narcotic analgesics without concern for their\\naddictive potential, or NSAIDs with only limited concern\\nfor their ulcerogenic risks. Drugs and doses should be\\nadjusted based on observation of healing rate, switching\\npatients from high to low doses, and from narcotic anal-\\ngesics to non-narcotics when circumstances permit.\\nAn important consideration of pain management in\\nsevere pain is that patients should not be subject to the\\nreturn of pain. Analgesics should be dosed adequately to\\nassure that the pain is at least tolerable, and frequently\\nenough to avoid the anxiety that accompanies the antici-\\npated return of pain. Analgesics should never be dosed on\\na “prn” (as needed) basis, but should be administered often\\nenough to assure constant blood levels of analgesic. This\\napplies to both the narcotic and non-narcotic analgesics.\\nChronic pain\\nChronic pain, pain lasting over three months and\\nsevere enough to impair function, is more difficult to\\ntreat, since the anticipated side effects of the analgesics\\nare more difficult to manage. In the case of narcotic anal-\\ngesics this means the addiction potential, as well as res-\\npiratory depression and constipation . For the NSAIDs,\\nthe risk of gastric ulcers may be dose limiting. While\\nsome classes of drugs, such as the narcotic agonist/antag-\\nonist drugs bupronophine, nalbuphine and pentazocine,\\nand the selective COX-2 inhibitors celecoxib and rofe-\\ncoxib represent advances in reduction of adverse effects,\\nthey are still not fully suitable for long-term management\\nof severe pain. Generally, chronic pain management\\nrequires a combination of drug therapy, life-style modifi-\\ncation, and other treatment modalities.\\nNarcotic analgesics\\nThe narcotic analgesics, also termed opioids, are all\\nderived from opium. The class includes morphine,\\ncodeine, and a number of semi-synthetics including\\nmeperidine (Demerol), propoxyphen (Darvon) and oth-\\ners. The narcotic analgesics vary in potency, but all are\\neffective in treatment of visceral pain when used in ade-\\nquate doses. Adverse effects are dose related. Because\\nthese drugs are all addictive, they are controlled under\\nfederal and state laws. A variety of dosage forms are\\navailable, including oral solids, liquids, intravenous and\\nintrathecal injections, and transcutaneous patches.\\nNSAIDs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, are\\neffective analgesics even at doses too low to have any\\nanti-inflammatory effects. There are a number of chemi-\\ncal classes, but all have similar therapeutic effects and\\nside effects. Most are appropriate only for oral adminis-\\ntration; however ketorolac (Toradol) is appropriate for\\ninjection and may be used in moderate to severe pain for\\nshort periods.\\nAcetaminophen is a non-narcotic analgesic with no\\nanti-inflammatory properties. It is appropriate for mild to\\nmoderate pain. Although the drug is well tolerated in nor-\\nmal doses, it may have significant toxicity at high doses.\\nBecause acetaminophen is largely free of side effects at\\ntherapeutic doses, it has been considered the first choice\\nfor mild pain, including that of osteoarthritis.\\nRecommended dosage\\nAppropriate dosage varies by drug, and should con-\\nsider the type of pain, as well as other risks associated\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2174\\nAnalgesics\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 174'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 192}, page_content='Description\\nAnaphylaxis is a type of allergic reaction, in which\\nthe immune system responds to otherwise harmless sub-\\nstances from the environment. Unlike other allergic\\nreactions, however, anaphylaxis can kill. Reaction may\\nbegin within minutes or even seconds of exposure, and\\nrapidly progress to cause airway constriction, skin and\\nintestinal irritation, and altered heart rhythms. In severe\\ncases, it can result in complete airway obstruction,\\nshock, and death.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nLike the majority of other allergic reactions, anaphy-\\nlaxis is caused by the release of histamine and other\\nchemicals from mast cells. Mast cells are a type of white\\nblood cell and they are found in large numbers in the tis-\\nsues that regulate exchange with the environment: the\\nairways, digestive system, and skin.\\nOn their surfaces, mast cells display antibodies\\ncalled IgE (immunoglobulin type E). These antibodies\\nare designed to detect environmental substances to\\nwhich the immune system is sensitive. Substances from\\na genuinely threatening source, such as bacteria or\\nviruses, are called antigens. A substance that most peo-\\nple tolerate well, but to which others have an allergic\\nresponse, is called an allergen. When IgE antibodies\\nbind with allergens, they cause the mast cell to release\\nhistamine and other chemicals, which spill out onto\\nneighboring cells.\\nThe interaction of these chemicals with receptors on\\nthe surface of blood vessels causes the vessels to leak\\nfluid into surrounding tissues, causing fluid accumula-\\ntion, redness, and swelling. On the smooth muscle cells\\nof the airways and digestive system, they cause constric-\\ntion. On nerve endings, they increase sensitivity and\\ncause itching.\\nIn anaphylaxis, the dramatic response is due both to\\nextreme hypersensivity to the allergen and its usually\\nsystemic distribution. Allergens are more likely to cause\\nanaphylaxis if they are introduced directly into the circu-\\nlatory system by injection. However, exposure by inges-\\ntion, inhalation, or skin contact can also cause anaphy-\\nlaxis. In some cases, anaphylaxis may develop over time\\nfrom less severe allergies.\\nAnaphylaxis is most often due to allergens in foods,\\ndrugs, and insect venom. Specific causes include:\\n• fish, shellfish, and mollusks\\n• nuts and seeds\\n• stings of bees, wasps, or hornets\\n• papain from meat tenderizers\\n• vaccines, including flu and measles vaccines\\n• penicillin\\n• cephalosporins\\n• streptomycin\\n• gamma globulin\\n• insulin\\n• hormones (ACTH, thyroid-stimulating hormone)\\n•aspirin and other NSAIDs\\n• latex, from exam gloves or condoms, for example\\nExposure to cold or exercise can trigger anaphylaxis\\nin some individuals.\\nSymptoms\\nSymptoms may include:\\n• urticaria (hives)\\n• swelling and irritation of the tongue or mouth\\n• swelling of the sinuses\\n• difficulty breathing\\n• wheezing\\n• cramping, vomiting, or diarrhea\\n• anxiety or confusion\\n• strong, very rapid heartbeat (palpitations)\\n• loss of consciousness\\nNot all symptoms may be present.\\nDiagnosis\\nAnaphylaxis is diagnosed based on the rapid devel-\\nopment of symptoms in response to a suspect allergen.\\nIdentification of the culprit may be done with RAST test-\\ning, a blood test that identifies IgE reactions to specific\\nallergens. Skin testing may be done for less severe ana-\\nphylactic reactions.\\nTreatment\\nEmergency treatment of anaphylaxis involves injec-\\ntion of adrenaline (epinephrine) which constricts blood\\nvessels and counteracts the effects of histamine. Oxygen\\nmay be given, as well as intravenous replacement fluids.\\nAntihistaminesmay be used for skin rash, and amino-\\nphylline for bronchial constriction. If the upper airway is\\nobstructed, placement of a breathing tube or tracheosto-\\nmy tube may be needed.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 179\\nAnaphylaxis\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 179'),\n",

Red blood cells, which contain\\nhemoglobin that allows them to deliver oxygen throughout\\nthe body, live for only about 120 days. When they die, the\\niron they contain is returned to the bone marrow and used\\nto create new red blood cells. Anemia develops when\\nheavy bleeding causes significant iron loss or when some-\\nthing happens to slow down the production of red blood\\ncells or to increase the rate at which they are destroyed.\\nTypes of anemia\\nAnemia can be mild, moderate, or severe enough to\\nlead to life-threatening complications. More than 400\\ndifferent types of anemia have been identified. Many of\\nthem are rare.\\nIRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA. Iron deficiency ane-\\nmia is the most common form of anemia in the world. In\\nthe United States, iron deficiency anemia affects about\\n240,000 toddlers between one and two years of age and\\n3.3 million women of childbearing age. This condition is\\nless common in older children and in adults over 50 and\\nrarely occurs in teenage boys and young men.\\nThe onset of iron deficiency anemia is gradual and,\\nat first, there may not be any symptoms. The deficiency\\nbegins when the body loses more iron than it derives\\nfrom food and other sources. Because depleted iron\\nstores cannot meet the red blood cell’s needs, fewer red\\nblood cells develop. In this early stage of anemia, the red\\nblood cells look normal, but they are reduced in number.\\nThen the body tries to compensate for the iron deficiency\\nby producing more red blood cells, which are character-\\nistically small in size. Symptoms develop at this stage.\\nFOLIC ACID DEFICIENCY ANEMIA. Folic acid defi-\\nciency anemia is the most common type of megaloblas-\\ntic anemia (in which red blood cells are bigger than nor-\\nmal). It is caused by a deficiency of folic acid, a vitamin\\nthat the body needs to produce normal cells.\\nFolic acid anemia is especially common in infants\\nand teenagers. Although this condition usually results\\nfrom a dietary deficiency, it is sometimes due to inability\\nto absorb enough folic acid from such foods as:\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2180\\nAnemias\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 180'),\n",

Folic acid anemia can be\\na complication of pregnancy, when a woman’s body\\nneeds eight times more folic acid than it does otherwise.\\nVITAMIN B12 DEFICIENCY ANEMIA. Less common in\\nthis country than folic acid anemia, vitamin B 12 deficien-\\ncy anemia is another type of megaloblastic anemia that\\ndevelops when the body doesn’t absorb enough of this\\nnutrient. Necessary for the creation of red blood cells, B12\\nis found in meat and vegetables.\\nLarge amounts of B 12 are stored in the body, so this\\ncondition may not become apparent until as much as four\\nyears after B12 absorption stops or slows down. The\\nresulting drop in red blood cell production can cause:\\n• loss of muscle control\\n• loss of sensation in the legs, hands, and feet\\n• soreness or burning of the tongue\\n• weight loss\\n• yellow-blue color blindness\\nThe most common form of B 12 deficiency is perni-\\ncious anemia . Since most people who eat meat or eggs\\nget enough B12 in their diets, a deficiency of this vitamin\\nusually means that the body is not absorbing it properly.\\nThis can occur among people who have had intestinal\\nsurgery or among those who do not produce adequate\\namounts of intrinsic factor, a chemical secreted by the\\nstomach lining that combines with B12 to help its absorp-\\ntion in the small intestine.\\nPernicious anemia usually strikes between the ages\\nof 50–60. Eating disorders or an unbalanced diet increas-\\nes the risk of developing pernicious anemia. So do:\\n• diabetes mellitus\\n•gastritis, stomach cancer, or stomach surgery\\n• thyroid disease\\n• family history of pernicious anemia\\nVITAMIN C DEFICIENCY ANEMIA. A rare disorder\\nthat causes the bone marrow to manufacture abnormally\\nsmall red blood cells, Vitamin C deficiency anemia\\nresults from a severe, long-standing dietary deficiency.\\nHEMOLYTIC ANEMIA. Some people are born with\\nhemolytic anemia . Some acquire this condition, in\\nwhich infection or antibodies destroy red blood cells\\nmore rapidly than bone marrow can replace them.\\nHemolytic anemia can enlarge the spleen, accelerat-\\ning the destruction of red blood cells (hemolysis). Other\\ncomplications of hemolytic anemia include:\\n• pain\\n• shock\\n• gallstones and other serious health problems\\nTHALASSEMIAS. An inherited form of hemolytic\\nanemia, thalassemia stems from the body’s inability to\\nmanufacture as much normal hemoglobin as it needs.\\nThere are two categories of thalassemia, depending on\\nwhich of the amino acid chains is affected. (Hemoglobin\\nis composed of four chains of amino acids.) In alpha-tha-\\nlassemia, there is an imbalance in the production of the\\nalpha chain of amino acids; in beta-thalassemia, there is\\nan imbalance in the beta chain. Alpha-thalassemias most\\ncommonly affect blacks (25% have at least one gene);\\nbeta-thalassemias most commonly affect people of\\nMediterranean ancestry and Southeast Asians.\\nCharacterized by production of red blood cells that\\nare unusually small and fragile, thalassemia only affects\\npeople who inherit the gene for it from each parent (auto-\\nsomal recessive inheritance).\\nAUTOIMMUNE HEMOLYTIC ANEMIAS. Warm anti-\\nbody hemolytic anemia is the most common type of this\\ndisorder. This condition occurs when the body produces\\nautoantibodies that coat red blood cells. The coated cells\\nare destroyed by the spleen, liver, or bone marrow.\\nWarm antibody hemolytic anemia is more common\\nin women than in men. About one-third of patients who\\nhave warm antibody hemolytic anemia also have lym-\\nphoma, leukemia, lupus, or connective tissue disease.\\nIn cold antibody hemolytic anemia, the body attacks\\nred blood cells at or below normal body temperature. The\\nacute form of this condition frequently develops in peo-\\nple who have had pneumonia, mononeucleosis, or other\\nacute infections. It tends to be mild and short-lived, and\\ndisappears without treatment.\\nChronic cold antibody hemolytic anemia is most\\ncommon in women and most often affects those who are\\nover 40 and who have arthritis. This condition usually\\nlasts for a lifetime, generally causing few symptoms.\\nHowever, exposure to cold temperatures can accelerate\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 181\\nAnemias\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 181'),\n",

Sickle cell anemia is a chron-\\nic, incurable condition that causes the body to produce\\ndefective hemoglobin, which forces red blood cells to\\nassume an abnormal crescent shape. Unlike normal oval\\ncells, fragile sickle cells can’t hold enough hemoglobin\\nto nourish body tissues. The deformed shape makes it\\nhard for sickle cells to pass through narrow blood ves-\\nsels. When capillaries become obstructed, a life-threaten-\\ning condition called sickle cell crisis is likely to occur.\\nSickle cell anemia is hereditary. It almost always\\naffects blacks and people of Mediterranean descent. A\\nchild who inherits the sickle cell gene from each parent\\nwill have the disease. A child who inherits the sickle cell\\ngene from only one parent carries the sickle cell trait, but\\ndoes not have the disease.\\nAPLASTIC ANEMIA. Sometimes curable by bone\\nmarrow transplant, but potentially fatal, aplastic anemia\\nis characterized by decreased production of red and\\nwhite blood cells and platelets (disc-shaped cells that\\nallow the blood to clot). This disorder may be inherited\\nor acquired as a result of:\\n• recent severe illness\\n• long-term exposure to industrial chemicals\\n• use of anticancer drugs and certain other medications\\nANEMIA OF CHRONIC DISEASE. Cancer, chronic\\ninfection or inflammation, and kidney and liver disease\\noften cause mild or moderate anemia. Chronic liver fail-\\nure generally produces the most severe symptoms.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAnemia is caused by bleeding, decreased red blood\\ncell production, or increased red blood cell destruction.\\nPoor diet can contribute to vitamin deficiency and iron\\ndeficiency anemias in which fewer red blood cells are\\nproduced. Hereditary disorders and certain diseases can\\ncause increased blood cell destruction. However, exces-\\nsive bleeding is the most common cause of anemia, and\\nthe speed with which blood loss occurs has a significant\\neffect on the severity of symptoms. Chronic blood loss is\\nusually a consequence of:\\n• cancer\\n• gastrointestinal tumors\\n• diverticulosis\\n• polyposis\\n• heavy menstrual flow\\n• hemorrhoids\\n• nosebleeds\\n• stomach ulcers\\n• long-standing alcohol abuse\\nAcute blood loss is usually the result of:\\n• childbirth\\n• injury\\n• a ruptured blood vessel\\n• surgery\\nWhen a lot of blood is lost within a short time, blood\\npressure and the amount of oxygen in the body drop sud-\\ndenly. Heart failure and death can follow.\\nLoss of even one-third of the body’s blood volume in\\nthe space of several hours can be fatal. More gradual blood\\nloss is less serious, because the body has time to create\\nnew red blood cells to replace those that have been lost.\\nSymptoms\\nWeakness, fatigue, and a run-down feeling may be\\nsigns of mild anemia. Skin that is pasty or sallow, or lack\\nof color in the creases of the palm, gums, nail beds, or\\nlining of the eyelids are other signs of anemia. Someone\\nwho is weak, tires easily, is often out of breath, and feels\\nfaint or dizzy may be severely anemic.\\nOther symptoms of anemia are:\\n• angina pectoris (chest pain, often accompanied by a\\nchoking sensation that provokes severe anxiety)\\n• cravings for ice, paint, or dirt\\n• headache\\n• inability to concentrate, memory loss\\n• inflammation of the mouth ( stomatitis ) or tongue\\n(glossitis)\\n• insomnia\\n• irregular heartbeat\\n• loss of appetite\\n• nails that are dry, brittle, or ridged\\n• rapid breathing\\n• sores in the mouth, throat, or rectum\\n• sweating\\n• swelling of the hands and feet\\n• thirst\\n• tinnitus (ringing in the ears)\\n• unexplained bleeding or bruising\\nIn pernicious anemia, the tongue feels unusually\\nslick.

If the cause is a deficiency,\\nfor example iron deficiency, folic acid deficiency, B12\\ndeficiency, or vitamin C deficiency, supplementation is\\nthe treatment. For extensive blood loss, the cause should\\nbe identified and corrected. Other types of anemias\\nshould be addressed on a deep healing level with crisis\\nintervention when necessary.\\nMany alternative therapies for iron-deficiency ane-\\nmia focus on adding iron-rich foods to the diet or on\\ntechniques to improve circulation and digestion. Iron\\nsupplementation, especially with iron citrate (less likely\\nto cause constipation), is used by alternative practition-\\ners. This can be given in combination with herbs that are\\nrich in iron. Some examples of iron-rich herbs are dande-\\nlion (Taraxacum officinale ), parsley ( Petroselinum\\ncrispum ), and nettle ( Urtica dioica ). The homeopathic\\nremedy ferrum phosphoricum can also be helpful.\\nAn iron-rich herbal tonic can also me made using\\nthe following recipe:\\n• soak 1/2 oz of yellow dock root and 1/2 oz dandelion\\nroot in 1 qt of boiled water for  four to 8 hours\\n• strain and simmer until the amount of liquid is reduced\\nto 1 cup\\n• remove from heat and add 1/2 cup black strap molasses,\\nmixing well\\n• store in refrigerator; take 1 tsp-2 Tbsp daily\\nOther herbal remedies used to treat iron-deficiency\\nanemia aim to improve the digestion. Gentian ( Gentiana\\nlutea) is widely used in Europe to treat anemia and other\\nnutritionally based disorders. The bitter qualities of gen-\\ntian help stimulate the digestive system, making iron and\\nother nutrients more available for absorption. This bitter\\nherb can be brewed into tea or purchased as an alcoholic\\nextract (tincture).\\nOther herbs recommended to promote digestion\\ninclude:\\n• anise (Pimpinella anisum)\\n• caraway (Carum carvi)\\n• cumin (Cuminum cyminum)\\n• linden (Tilia spp.)\\n• licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra)\\nTraditional Chinese treatments for anemia include:\\n• acupuncture to stimulate a weakened spleen\\n• asian ginseng (Panax ginseng) to restore energy\\n• dong quai ( Angelica sinensis ) to control heavy men-\\nstrual bleeding\\n• a mixture of dong quai and Chinese foxglove(Rehman-\\nnia glutinosa) to clear a sallow complexion\\nPrognosis\\nFolic-acid and iron-deficiency anemias\\nIt usually takes three to six weeks to correct folic\\nacid or iron deficiency anemia. Patients should continue\\ntaking supplements for another six months to replenish\\niron reserves and should have periodic blood tests to\\nmake sure the bleeding has stopped and the anemia has\\nnot recurred.\\nPernicious anemia\\nAlthough pernicious anemia is considered incurable,\\nregular B 12 shots will alleviate symptoms and reverse\\ncomplications.

The patient experiences analge-\\nsia or a loss of pain sensation but remains conscious\\nand can carry on a conversation.\\n• Stage Two: Excitement. The patient may experience\\ndelirium or become violent. Blood pressure rises and\\nbecomes irregular, and breathing rate increases. This\\nstage is typically bypassed by administering a barbitu-\\nrate, such as sodium pentothal, before the anesthesia.\\n• Stage Three: Surgical Anesthesia. During this stage, the\\nskeletal muscles relax, and the patient’s breathing\\nbecomes regular. Eye movements slow, then stop, and\\nsurgery can begin.\\n• Stage Four: Medullary Paralysis . This stage occurs if\\nthe respiratory centers in the medulla oblongata of the\\nbrain that control breathing and other vital functions\\ncease to function. Death can result if the patient cannot\\nbe revived quickly. This stage should never be reached.\\nCareful control of the amounts of anesthetics adminis-\\ntered prevent this occurrence.\\nAgents used for general anesthesia may be either\\ngases or volatile liquids that are vaporized and inhaled\\nwith oxygen, or drugs delivered intravenously. A combi-\\nnation of inhaled anesthetic gases and intravenous drugs\\nare usually delivered during general anesthesia; this\\npractice is called balanced anesthesia and is used because\\nit takes advantage of the beneficial effects of each anes-\\nthetic agent to reach surgical anesthesia. If necessary, the\\nextent of the anesthesia produced by inhaling a general\\nanesthetic can be rapidly modified by adjusting the con-\\ncentration of the anesthetic in the oxygen that is breathed\\nby the patient. The degree of anesthesia produced by an\\nintravenously injected anesthesic is fixed and cannot be\\nchanged as rapidly. Most commonly, intravenous anes-\\nthetic agents are used for induction of anesthesia and\\nthen followed by inhaled anesthetic agents.\\nGeneral anesthesia works by altering the flow of\\nsodium molecules into nerve cells (neurons) through the\\ncell membrane. Exactly how the anesthetic does this is\\nnot understood since the drug apparently does not bind to\\nany receptor on the cell surface and does not seem to\\naffect the release of chemicals that transmit nerve\\nimpulses (neurotransmitters) from the nerve cells. It is\\nknown, however, that when the sodium molecules do not\\nget into the neurons, nerve impulses are not generated\\nand the brain becomes unconscious, does not store mem-\\nories, does not register pain impulses from other areas of\\nthe body, and does not control involuntary reflexes.\\nAlthough anesthesia may feel like deep sleep, it is not the\\nsame. In sleep, some parts of the brain speed up while\\nothers slow down. Under anesthesia, the loss of con-\\nsciousness is more widespread.\\nWhen general anesthesia was first introduced in\\nmedical practice, ether and chloroform were inhaled with\\nthe physician manually covering the patient’s mouth.\\nSince then, general anesthesia has become much more\\nsophisticated. During most surgical procedures, anesthet-\\nic agents are now delivered and controlled by computer-\\nized equipment that includes anesthetic gas monitoring\\nas well as patient monitoring equipment. Anesthesiolo-\\ngists are the physicians that specialize in the delivery of\\nanesthetic agents. Currently used inhaled general anes-\\nthetics include halothane, enflurane, isoflurane, desfluo-\\nrane, sevofluorane, and nitrous oxide.\\n• Halothane (Fluothane) is a powerful anesthetic and can\\neasily be overadministered. This drug causes uncon-\\nsciousness but little pain relief so it is often used with\\nother agents to control pain. Very rarely, it can be toxic\\nto the liver in adults, causing death. It also has the\\npotential for causing serious cardiac dysrhythmias.\\nHalothane has a pleasant odor, and was frequently the\\nanesthetic of choice for use with children, but since the\\nintroduction of sevofluorane in the 1990s, halothane\\nuse has declined.\\n• Enflurane (Ethrane) is less potent and results in a\\nmore rapid onset of anesthesia and faster awakening\\nthan halothane. In addition, it acts as an enhancer of\\nparalyzing agents. Enflurane has been found to\\nincrease intracranial pressure and the risk of seizures;\\ntherefore, its use is contraindicated in patients with\\nseizure disorders.\\n• Isoflurane (Forane) is not toxic to the liver but can\\ncause some cardiac irregularities. Isofluorane is often\\nused in combination with intravenous anesthetics for\\nanesthesia induction. Awakening from anesthesia is\\nfaster than it is with halothane and enfluorane.\\n• Desfluorane (Suprane) may increase the heart rate and\\nshould not be used in patients with aortic valve steno-\\nsis; however, it does not usually cause heart arrhyth-\\nmias. Desflurane may cause coughing and excitation\\nduring induction and is therefore used with intravenous\\nanesthetics for induction. Desflurane is rapidly elimi-\\nnated and awakening is therefore faster than with other\\ninhaled agents.\\n• Sevofluorane (Ultane) may also cause increased heart\\nrate and should not be used in patients with narrowed\\naortic valve (stenosis); however, it does not usually\\ncause heart arrhythmias. Unlike desfluorane, sevofluo-\\nrane does not cause any coughing or other related side\\neffects, and can therefore be used without intravenous\\nagents for rapid induction. For this reason, sevofluorane\\nis replacing halothane for induction in pediatric\\npatients. Like desfluorane, this agent is rapidly elimi-\\nnated and allows rapid awakening.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2186\\nAnesthesia, general\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 186'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 200}, page_content='• Nitrous oxide (laughing gas) is a weak anesthetic and is\\nused with other agents, such as thiopental, to produce\\nsurgical anesthesia. It has the fastest induction and\\nrecovery and is the safest because it does not slow\\nbreathing or blood flow to the brain. However, it diffus-\\nes rapidly into air-containing cavities and can result in a\\ncollapsed lung (pneumothorax ) or lower the oxygen\\ncontents of tissues (hypoxia).\\nCommonly administered intravenous anesthetic\\nagents include ketamine, thiopental, opioids, and propofol.\\n• Ketamine (Ketalar) affects the senses, and produces a\\ndissociative anesthesia (catatonia, amnesia, analgesia)\\nin which the patient may appear awake and reactive, but\\ncannot respond to sensory stimuli. These properties\\nmake it especially useful for use in developing coun-\\ntries and during warfare medical treatment. Ketamine is\\nfrequently used in pediatric patients because anesthesia\\nand analgesia can be achieved with an intramuscular\\ninjection. It is also used in high-risk geriatric patients\\nand in shock cases, because it also provides cardiac\\nstimulation.\\n• Thiopental (Pentothal) is a barbiturate that induces a\\nrapid hypnotic state of short duration. Because thiopen-\\ntal is slowly metabolized by the liver, toxic accumula-\\ntion can occur; therefore, it should not be continuously\\ninfused. Side effects include nausea and vomiting\\nupon awakening.\\n• Opioids include fentanyl, sufentanil, and alfentanil, and\\nare frequently used prior to anesthesia and surgery as a\\nsedative and analgesic, as well as a continuous infusion\\nfor primary anesthesia. Because opioids rarely affect\\nthe cardiovascular system, they are particularly useful\\nfor cardiac surgery and other high-risk cases. Opioids\\nact directly on spinal cord receptors, and are freqently\\nused in epidurals for spinal anesthesia. Side effects may\\ninclude nausea and vomiting,itching, and respiratory\\ndepression.\\n• Propofol (Diprivan) is a nonbarbiturate hypnotic agent\\nand the most recently developed intravenous anesthetic.\\nIts rapid induction and short duration of action are iden-\\ntical to thiopental, but recovery occurs more quickly\\nand with much less nausea and vomiting. Also, propo-\\nfol is rapidly metabolized in the liver and excreted in\\nthe urine, so it can be used for long durations of anes-\\nthesia, unlike thiopental. Hence, propofol is rapidly\\nreplacing thiopental as an intravenous induction agent.\\nIt is used for general surgery , cardiac surgery, neuro-\\nsurgery, and pediatric surgery.\\nGeneral anesthetics are given only by anesthesiolo-\\ngists, the medical professionals trained to use them. These\\nspecialists consider many factors, including a patient’s\\nage, weight, medication allergies, medical history, and\\ngeneral health, when deciding which anesthetic or combi-\\nnation of anesthetics to use. General anesthetics are usual-\\nly inhaled through a mask or a breathing tube or injected\\ninto a vein, but are also sometimes given rectally.\\nGeneral anesthesia is much safer today than it was in\\nthe past. This progress is due to faster-acting anesthetics,\\nimproved safety standards in the equipment used to\\ndeliver the drugs, and better devices to monitor breath-\\ning, heart rate, blood pressure, and brain activity during\\nsurgery. Unpleasant side effects are also less common.\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe dosage depends on the type of anesthetic, the\\npatient’s age and physical condition, the type of surgery\\nor medical procedure being done, and other medication\\nthe patient takes before, during, or after surgery.\\nPrecautions\\nAlthough the risks of serious complications from\\ngeneral anesthesia are very low, they can include heart\\nattack, stroke, brain damage, and death. Anyone sched-\\nuled to undergo general anesthesia should thoroughly\\ndiscuss the benefits and risks with a physician. The risks\\nof complications depend, in part, on a patient’s age, sex,\\nweight, allergies, general health, and history of smoking,\\ndrinking alcohol, or drug use. Some of these risks can be\\nminimized by ensuring that the physician and anesthesi-\\nologist are fully informed of the detailed health condition\\nof the patient, including any drugs that he or she may be\\nusing. Older people are especially sensitive to the effects\\nof certain anesthetics and may be more likely to experi-\\nence side effects from these drugs.\\nPatients who have had general anesthesia should not\\ndrink alcoholic beverages or take medication that slow\\ndown the central nervous system (such as antihista-\\nmines, sedatives, tranquilizers, sleep aids, certain pain\\nrelievers, muscle relaxants, and anti-seizure medication)\\nfor at least 24 hours, except under a doctor’s care.\\nSpecial conditions\\nPeople with certain medical conditions are at greater\\nrisk of developing problems with anesthetics. Before\\nundergoing general anesthesia, anyone with the follow-\\ning conditions should absolutely inform their doctor.\\nALLERGIES.

Signs of malignant\\nhyperthermia include rapid, irregular heartbeat, breath-\\ning problems, very high fever, and muscle tightness or\\nspasms. These symptoms can occur following the admin-\\nistration of general anesthesia using inhaled agents, espe-\\ncially halothane. In addition, the doctor should also be\\ntold about any allergies to foods, dyes, preservatives, or\\nother substances.\\nPREGNANCY. The effects of anesthetics on pregnant\\nwomen and fetuses vary, depending on the type of drug. In\\ngeneral, giving large amounts of general anesthetics to the\\nmother during labor and delivery may make the baby slug-\\ngish after delivery. Pregnant women should discuss the use\\nof anesthetics during labor and delivery with their doctors.\\nPregnant women who may be given general anesthesia for\\nother medical procedures should ensure that the treating\\nphysician is informed about the pregnancy.\\nBREASTFEEDING. Some general anesthetics pass into\\nbreast milk, but they have not been reported to cause prob-\\nlems in nursing babies whose mothers were given the drugs.\\nOTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Before being given\\na general anesthetic, a patient who has any of the follow-\\ning conditions should inform his or her doctor:\\n• neurological conditions, such as epilepsy or stroke\\n• problems with the stomach or esophagus, such as ulcers\\nor heartburn\\n• eating disorders\\n• loose teeth, dentures, bridgework\\n• heart disease or family history of heart problems\\n• lung diseases, such as emphysema or asthma\\n• history of smoking\\n• immune system diseases\\n• arthritis or any other conditions that affect movement\\n• diseases of the endocrine system, such as diabetes or\\nthyroid problems\\nSide effects\\nBecause general anesthetics affect the central ner-\\nvous system, patients may feel drowsy, weak, or tired\\nfor as long as a few days after having general anesthesia.\\nFuzzy thinking, blurred vision, and coordination prob-\\nlems are also possible.

Local anesthesia involves\\nthe injection into the skin or muscle or application to the\\nskin of an anesthetic directly where pain will occur. Local\\nanesthesia can be divided into four groups: injectable, topi-\\ncal, dental (non-injectable), and ophthalmic.\\nLocal and regional anesthesia work by altering the\\nflow of sodium molecules into nerve cells or neurons\\nthrough the cell membrane. Exactly how the anesthetic\\ndoes this is not understood, since the drug apparently\\ndoes not bind to any receptor on the cell surface and does\\nnot seem to affect the release of chemicals that transmit\\nnerve impulses (neurotransmitters) from the nerve cells.\\nIt is known, however, that when the sodium molecules do\\nnot get into the neurons, nerve impulses are not generat-\\ned and pain impulses are not transmitted to the brain. The\\nduration of action of an anesthetic depends on the type\\nand amount of anesthetic administered.\\nRegional anesthesia\\nTypes of regional anesthesia include:\\n• Spinal anesthesia. Spinal anesthesia involves the injec-\\ntion of a small amount of local anesthetic directly into\\nthe cerebrospinal fluid surrounding the spinal cord (the\\nsubarachnoid space). Blood pressure drops are com-\\nmon but are easily treated.\\n• Epidural anesthesia. Epidural anesthesia involves the\\ninjection of a large volume of local anesthetic directly\\ninto the space surrounding the spinal fluid sac (the\\nepidural space), not into the spinal fluid. Pain relief\\noccurs more slowly but is less likely to produce blood\\npressure drops. Also, the block can be maintained for\\nlong periods, even days.\\n• Nerve blocks. Nerve blocks involve the injection of an\\nanesthetic into the area around a nerve that supplies a\\nparticular region of the body, preventing the nerve from\\ncarrying nerve impulses to the brain.\\nAnesthetics may be administered with another drug,\\nsuch as epinephrine (adrenaline), which decreases bleed-\\ning, and sodium bicarbonate to decrease the acidity of a\\ndrug so that it will work faster. In addition, drugs may be\\nadministered to help a patient remain calm and more\\ncomfortable or to make them sleepy.\\nLocal anesthesia\\nINJECTABLE LOCAL ANESTHETICS. These medicines\\nare given by injection to numb and provide pain relief to\\nsome part of the body during surgery, dental procedures,\\nor other medical procedures. They are given only by a\\ntrained health care professional and only in a doctor’s\\noffice or a hospital. Some commonly used injectable\\nlocal anesthetics are procaine (Novocain), lidocaine\\n(Dalcaine, Dilocaine, L-Caine, Nervocaine, Xylocaine,\\nand other brands), and tetracaine (Pontocaine).\\nTOPICAL ANESTHETICS. Topical anesthetics, such as\\nbenzocaine, lidocaine, dibucaine, pramoxine, butamben,\\nand tetracaine, relieve pain and itching by deadening the\\nnerve endings in the skin. They are ingredients in a vari-\\nety of nonprescription products that are applied to the\\nskin to relieve the discomfort of sunburn, insect bites or\\nstings, poison ivy, and minor cuts, scratches, and burns.\\nThese products are sold as creams, ointments, sprays,\\nlotions, and gels.\\nDENTAL ANESTHETICS (NON-INJECTABLE). Some\\nlocal anesthetics are intended for pain relief in the mouth\\nor throat. They may be used to relieve throat pain,\\nteething pain, painful canker sores, toothaches, or dis-\\ncomfort from dentures, braces, or bridgework. Some\\ndental anesthetics are available only with a doctor’s pre-\\nscription. Others may be purchased without a prescrip-\\ntion, including products such as Num-Zit, Orajel, Chlo-\\nraseptic lozenges, and Xylocaine.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2190\\nAnesthesia, local\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 190'),\n",

Other medications may be given in\\nconjunction with the anesthetic, however, to relieve anxi-\\nety and help the patient relax.\\nLocal anesthetics should be used only for the condi-\\ntions for which they are intended. For example, a topical\\nanesthetic meant to relieve sunburn pain should not be\\nused on cold sores. Anyone who has had an unusual reac-\\ntion to any local anesthetic in the past should check with\\na doctor before using any type of local anesthetic again.\\nThe doctor should also be told about any allergies to\\nfoods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances.\\nOlder people may be more sensitive to the effects of\\nlocal anesthetics, especially lidocaine. This increased sen-\\nsitivity may increase the risk of side effects. Older people\\nwho use nonprescription local anesthetics should be espe-\\ncially careful not to use more than the recommended\\namount. Children also may be especially sensitive to the\\neffects of some local anesthetics, which may increase the\\nchance of side effects. Anyone using these medicines on a\\nchild should be careful not to use more than the amount\\nthat is recommended for children. Certain types of local\\nanesthetics should not be used at all young children. Fol-\\nlow package directions carefully and check with a doctor\\nof pharmacist if there are any questions.\\nRegional anesthetics\\nSerious, possibly life-threatening, side effects may\\noccur when anesthetics are given to people who use\\nstreet drugs.

The aorta is the largest\\nartery in the body and the main blood vessel leading\\naway from the heart.\\nPurpose\\nThe purpose of aneurysmectomy is to repair an aor-\\ntic aneurysm that is likely to rupture if left in place.\\nAneurysmectomy is indicated for an aortic aneurysm that\\ngrows to at least 2 in (5 cm) or for an aortic aneurysm of\\nany size that is symptomatic, tender, or enlarging rapidly.\\nPrecautions\\nAneurysmectomy may not be appropriate for\\npatients with severely debilitating diseases such as can-\\ncer, emphysema, and heart failure.\\nDescription\\nAn aortic aneurysm is a bulge in the wall of the aorta\\nthat is usually due to arteriosclerosis or atherosclerosis.\\nPeople who are 50-80 years old are most likely to devel-\\nop an aortic aneurysm, with men four times more likely\\nto develop one than women.\\nAn aortic aneurysm develops and grows slowly. It\\nrarely produces symptoms and is usually only diagnosed\\nby accident during a routine physical exam or on an x ray\\nor ultrasound done for another reason. As the aneurysm\\ngrows larger, the risk of bursting with no warning, which\\ncauses catastrophic bleeding, rises. A ruptured aortic\\naneurysm can cause sudden loss of a fatal amount of blood\\nwithin minutes or it can leak in a series of small bleeds\\nthat lead within hours or days to massive bleeding. A leak-\\ning aortic aneurysm that is not treated is always fatal.\\nAneurysmectomy is performed to repair the two\\nmost common types of aortic aneurysms: abdominal aor-\\ntic aneurysms that occur in the abdomen below the kid-\\nneys, and thoracic aortic aneurysms that occur in the\\nchest. It is major surgery performed in a hospital under\\ngeneral anesthesia and involves removing debris and\\nthen implanting a flexible tube (graft) to replace the\\nenlarged artery. Aneurysmectomy for an aneurysm of the\\nascending aorta (the first part of the aorta that travels\\nupward from the heart) requires the use of a heart-lung\\nmachine that temporarily stops the heart while the\\naneurysm is repaired. Aneurysmectomy requires a one-\\nweek hospital stay; the recovery period is five weeks.\\nDuring surgery, the site of the aneurysm (either the\\nabdomen or the chest) is opened with an incision to expose\\nthe aneurysm. The aorta is clamped above and below the\\naneurysm to stop the flow of blood. Then, an incision is\\nmade in the aneurysm. An artificial Dacron tube is sewn in\\nplace above and below the opened aneurysm, but the\\naneurysm is not removed. Plaque or clotted blood are\\ncleaned from the diseased tissue. The clamps are removed\\nand blood flow is re-established through the graft. The\\nwall of the aneurysm is wrapped around the graft to pro-\\ntect it and the skin of the abdomen or chest is sewn up.\\nAneurysmectomy can be performed as elective or\\nemergency surgery. Elective aneurysmectomy takes about\\nan hour and is far safer than emergency aneurysmectomy,\\nwith a mortality rate of 3-5% for elective abdominal\\naneurysmectomy and 5-10% for elective thoracic\\naneurysmectomy. When an aneurysm ruptures, 62% of\\npatients die before they reach the hospital. Of those who\\nmake it into emergency aneurysmectromy, 50% die. After\\na successful aneurysmectomy, the patient has nearly the\\nsame life expectancy as other people of the same age.\\nPreparation\\nBefore elective aneurysmectomy, blood studies, a\\nchest x ray , cardiac catherization, electrocardiogram\\n(ECG), and ultrasound are performed.\\nAftercare\\nAfter aneurysmectomy, the patient is monitored in\\nan Intensive Care Unit for the first 24–48 hours. Follow-\\nup tests include ECG, chest x ray, and ultrasound.\\nRisks\\nElective aneurysmectomy has a 5-10% rate of compli-\\ncations, such as bleeding, kidney failure, respiratory com-\\nplications,heart attack, stroke, infection, limb loss, bowel\\nischemia, and impotence. These complications are many\\ntimes more common in emergency aneurysmectomy.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 193\\nAneurysmectomy\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 193'),\n",

It is also some-\\ntimes characterized by a feeling of choking, suffocation,\\nor crushing heaviness. This condition is also called angi-\\nna pectoris.\\nDescription\\nOften described as a muscle spasm and choking sen-\\nsation, the term “angina” is used primarily to describe\\nchest (thoracic) pain originating from insufficient oxygen\\nto the heart muscle. An episode of angina is not an actual\\nheart attack, but rather pain that results from the heart\\nmuscle temporarily receiving too little blood. This tem-\\nporary condition may be the result of demanding activi-\\nties such as exercise and does not necessarily indicate\\nthat the heart muscle is experiencing permanent damage.\\nIn fact, episodes of angina seldom cause permanent dam-\\nage to heart muscle.\\nAngina can be subdivided further into two cate-\\ngories: angina of effort and variant angina.\\nAngina of effort\\nAngina of effort is a common disorder caused by the\\nnarrowing of the arteries ( atherosclerosis ) that supply\\noxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle. In the case of\\nangina of effort, the heart (coronary) arteries can provide\\nthe heart muscle (myocardium) adequate blood during\\nrest but not during periods of exercise,stress, or excite-\\nment—any of which may precipitate pain. The pain is\\nrelieved by resting or by administering nitroglycerin, a\\nmedication that reduces ischemia of the heart. Patients\\nwith angina of effort have an increased risk of heart\\nattack (myocardial infarction).\\nV ariant angina\\nVariant angina is uncommon and occurs indepen-\\ndently of atherosclerosis which may, however, be present\\nas an incidental finding. Variant angina occurs at rest and\\nis not related to excessive work by the heart muscle.\\nResearch indicates that variant angina is caused by coro-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2194\\nAngina\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 194'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 208}, page_content='nary artery muscle spasm of insufficient duration or\\nintensity to cause an actual heart attack.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAngina causes a pressing pain or sensation of heavi-\\nness, usually in the chest area under the breast bone (ster-\\nnum). It occasionally is experienced in the shoulder, arm,\\nneck, or jaw regions. Because episodes of angina occur\\nwhen the heart’s need for oxygen increases beyond the\\noxygen available from the blood nourishing the heart, the\\ncondition is often precipitated by physical exertion. In\\nmost cases, the symptoms are relieved within a few min-\\nutes by resting or by taking prescribed angina medica-\\ntions. Emotional stress, extreme temperatures, heavy\\nmeals, cigarette smoking, and alcohol can also cause or\\ncontribute to an episode of angina.\\nDiagnosis\\nPhysicians can usually diagnose angina based on the\\npatient’s symptoms and the precipitating factors. Howev-\\ner, other diagnostic testing is often required to confirm or\\nrule out angina, or to determine the severity of the under-\\nlying heart disease.\\nElectrocardiogram (ECG)\\nAn electrocardiogram is a test that records electrical\\nimpulses from the heart. The resulting graph of electrical\\nactivity can show if the heart muscle isn’t functioning\\nproperly as a result of a lack of oxygen. Electrocardio-\\ngrams are also useful in investigating other possible\\nabnormal features of the heart.\\nStress test\\nFor many individuals with angina, the results of an\\nelectrocardiogram while at rest will not show any abnor-\\nmalities. Because the symptoms of angina occur during\\nstress, the functioning of the heart may need to be evalu-\\nated under the physical stress of exercise. The stress test\\nrecords information from the electrocardiogram before,\\nduring, and after exercise in search of stress-related\\nabnormalities. Blood pressure is also measured during\\nthe stress test and symptoms are noted. A more involved\\nand complex stress test (for example, thallium scanning)\\nmay be used in some cases to picture the blood flow in\\nthe heart muscle during the most intense time of exercise\\nand after rest.\\nAngiogram\\nThe angiogram, which is basically an x ray of the\\ncoronary artery, has been noted to be the most accurate\\ndiagnostic test to indicate the presence and extent of\\ncoronary disease. In this procedure, a long, thin, flexible\\ntube (catheter) is maneuvered into an artery located in\\nthe forearm or groin. This catheter is passed further\\nthrough the artery into one of the two major coronary\\narteries. A dye is injected at that time to help the x rays\\n“see” the heart and arteries more clearly. Many brief x\\nrays are made to create a “movie” of blood flowing\\nthrough the coronary arteries, which will reveal any pos-\\nsible narrowing that causes a decrease in blood flow to\\nthe heart muscle and associated symptoms of angina.\\nTreatment\\nConservative treatment\\nArtery disease causing angina is addressed initially by\\ncontrolling existing factors placing the individual at risk.\\nThese risk factors include cigarette smoking, high blood\\npressure,high cholesterol levels, and obesity. Angina is\\noften controlled by medication, most commonly with\\nnitroglycerin. This drug relieves symptoms of angina by\\nincreasing the diameter of the blood vessels carrying\\nblood to the heart muscle. Nitroglycerin is taken whenever\\ndiscomfort occurs or is expected. It may be taken by\\nmouth by placing the tablet under the tongue or transder-\\nmally by placing a medicated patch directly on the skin. In\\naddition,beta blockers or calcium channel blockers\\nmay be prescribed to also decrease the demand on the\\nheart by decreasing the rate and workload of the heart.\\nSurgical treatment\\nWhen conservative treatments are not effective in\\nthe reduction of angina pain and the risk of heart attack\\nremains high, physicians may recommend angioplasty\\nor surgery. Coronary artery bypass surgery is an opera-\\ntion in which a blood vessel (often a long vein surgically\\nremoved from the leg) is grafted onto the blocked artery\\nto bypass the blocked portion. This newly formed path-\\nway allows blood to flow adequately to the heart muscle.\\nAnother procedure used to improve blood flow to\\nthe heart is balloon angioplasty. In this procedure, the\\nphysician inserts a catheter with a tiny balloon at the end\\ninto a forearm or groin artery. The catheter is then thread-\\ned up into the coronary arteries and the balloon is inflat-\\ned to open the vessel in narrowed sections. Other tech-\\nniques using laser and mechanical devices are being\\ndeveloped and applied, also by means of catheters.\\nAlternative treatment\\nDuring an angina episode, relief has been noted by\\napplying massage or kinesiological methods, but these\\ntechniques are not standard recommendations by physi-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 195\\nAngina\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 195'),\n",

For example, one technique places the palm and\\nfingers of either hand on the forehead while simultane-\\nously firmly massaging the sternum (breast bone) up and\\ndown its entire length using the other hand. This is fol-\\nlowed by additional massaging by the fingertip and\\nthumb next to the sternum, on each side.\\nOnce the angina has subsided, the cause should be\\ndetermined and treated. Atherosclerosis, a major associat-\\ned cause, requires diet and lifestyle adjustments, primari-\\nly including regular exercise, reduction of dietary sugar\\nand saturated fats, and increase of dietary fiber. Both con-\\nventional and alternative medicine agree that increasing\\nexercise and improving diet are important steps to reduce\\nhigh cholesterol levels. Alternative medicine has pro-\\nposed specific cholesterol-lowering treatments, with sev-\\neral gaining the attention and interest of the public. One\\nof the most recent popular treatments is garlic (Allium\\nsativum). Some studies have shown that adequate dosages\\nof garlic can reduce total cholesterol by about 10%, LDL\\n(bad) cholesterol by 15%, and raise HDL (good) choles-\\nterol by 10%. Other studies have not shown significant\\nbenefit. Although its effect on cholesterol is not as great\\nas that achieved by medications, garlic may possibly be of\\nbenefit in relatively mild cases of high cholesterol, with-\\nout causing the side effects associated with cholesterol-\\nreducing drugs . Other herbal remedies that may help\\nlower cholesterol include alfalfa (Medicago sativa), fenu-\\ngreek ( Trigonella foenum-graecum ), Asian ginseng\\n(Panax ginseng), and tumeric (Curcuma longa).\\nAntioxidants, including vitamin A (beta carotene),\\nvitamin C, vitamin E, and selenium, can limit the oxida-\\ntive damage to the walls of blood vessels that may be a\\nprecursor of atherosclerotic plaque formation.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for a patient with angina depends on\\nits origin, type, severity, and the general health of the\\nindividual. A person who has angina has the best progno-\\nsis if he or she seeks prompt medical attention and learns\\nthe pattern of his or her angina, such as what causes the\\nattacks, what they feel like, how long episodes usually\\nlast, and whether medication relieves the attacks. If pat-\\nterns of the symptoms change significantly, or if symp-\\ntoms resemble those of a heart attack, medical help\\nshould be sought immediately.\\nPrevention\\nIn most cases, the best prevention involves changing\\none’s habits to avoid bringing on attacks of angina.

The dye is\\ninjected through a procedure known as arterial puncture.\\nThe puncture is usually made in the groin area, armpit,\\ninside elbow, or neck. The site is cleaned with an antisep-\\ntic agent and injected with a local anesthetic. First, a\\nsmall incision is made in the skin to help the needle pass.\\nA needle containing an inner wire called a stylet is insert-\\ned through the skin into the artery. When the radiologist\\nhas punctured the artery with the needle, the stylet is\\nremoved and replaced with another long wire called a\\nguide wire. It is normal for blood to spout out of the nee-\\ndle before the guide wire is inserted.\\nThe guide wire is fed through the outer needle into\\nthe artery and to the area that requires angiographic\\nstudy. A fluoroscopic screen that displays a view of the\\npatient’s vascular system is used to pilot the wire to the\\ncorrect location. Once it is in position, the needle is\\nremoved and a catheter is slid over the length of the\\nguide wire until it to reaches the area of study. The guide\\nwire is removed and the catheter is left in place in prepa-\\nration for the injection of the contrast medium, or dye.\\nDepending on the type of angiography procedure\\nbeing performed, the contrast medium is either injected\\nby hand with a syringe or is mechanically injected with\\nan automatic injector connected to the catheter. An\\nautomatic injector is used frequently because it is able\\nto propel a large volume of dye very quickly to the\\nangiogram site. The patient is warned that the injection\\nwill start, and instructed to remain very still. The injec-\\ntion causes some mild to moderate discomfort. Possible\\nside effects or reactions include headache , dizziness ,\\nirregular heartbeat, nausea, warmth, burning sensation,\\nand chest pain, but they usually last only momentarily.\\nTo view the area of study from different angles or per-\\nspectives, the patient may be asked to change positions\\nseveral times, and subsequent dye injections may be\\nadministered. During any injection, the patient or the\\ncamera may move.\\nThroughout the dye injection procedure, x-ray pic-\\ntures and/or fluoroscopic pictures (or moving x rays) will\\nbe taken. Because of the high pressure of arterial blood\\nflow, the dye will dissipate through the patient’s system\\nquickly, so pictures must be taken in rapid succession.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 197\\nAngiography\\nAn angiogram of a coronary artery.(Phototake NYC.

A pressure bandage is\\nthen applied.\\nMost angiograms follow the general procedures out-\\nlined above, but vary slightly depending on the area of\\nthe vascular system being studied. A variety of common\\nangiography procedures are outlined below:\\nCerebral angiography\\nCerebral angiography is used to detect aneurysms,\\nblood clots, and other vascular irregularities in the brain.\\nThe catheter is inserted into the femoral or carotid artery\\nand the injected contrast medium travels through the\\nblood vessels on the brain. Patients frequently experience\\nheadache, warmth, or a burning sensation in the head or\\nneck during the injection portion of the procedure. A\\ncerebral angiogram takes two to four hours to complete.\\nCoronary angiography\\nCoronary angiography is administered by a cardiol-\\nogist with training in radiology or, occasionally, by a\\nradiologist. The arterial puncture is typically given in the\\nfemoral artery, and the cardiologist uses a guide wire and\\ncatheter to perform a contrast injection and x-ray series\\non the coronary arteries. The catheter may also be placed\\nin the left ventricle to examine the mitral and aortic\\nvalves of the heart. If the cardiologist requires a view of\\nthe right ventricle of the heart or of the tricuspid or pul-\\nmonic valves, the catheter will be inserted through a\\nlarge vein and guided into the right ventricle. The\\ncatheter also serves the purpose of monitoring blood\\npressures in these different locations inside the heart. The\\nangiogram procedure takes several hours, depending on\\nthe complexity of the procedure.\\nPulmonary angiography\\nPulmonary, or lung, angiography is performed to\\nevaluate blood circulation to the lungs. It is also consid-\\nered the most accurate diagnostic test for detecting a pul-\\nmonary embolism. The procedure differs from cerebral\\nand coronary angiograms in that the guide wire and\\ncatheter are inserted into a vein instead of an artery, and\\nare guided up through the chambers of the heart and into\\nthe pulmonary artery. Throughout the procedure, the\\npatient’s vital signs are monitored to ensure that the\\ncatheter doesn’t cause arrhythmias , or irregular heart-\\nbeats. The contrast medium is then injected into the pul-\\nmonary artery where it circulates through the lung capil-\\nlaries. The test typically takes up to 90 minutes.\\nKidney angiography\\nPatients with chronic renal disease or injury can suf-\\nfer further damage to their kidneys from the contrast\\nmedium used in a kidney angiogram, yet they often\\nrequire the test to evaluate kidney function. These\\npatients should be well-hydrated with a intravenous\\nsaline drip before the procedure, and may benefit from\\navailable medications (e.g., dopamine) that help to pro-\\ntect the kidney from further injury due to contrast agents.\\nDuring a kidney angiogram, the guide wire and catheter\\nare inserted into the femoral artery in the groin area and\\nadvanced through the abdominal aorta, the main artery in\\nthe abdomen, and into the renal arteries. The procedure\\nwill take approximately one hour.\\nFluorescein angiography\\nFluorescein angiography is used to diagnose retinal\\nproblems and circulatory disorders. It is typically con-\\nducted as an outpatient procedure. The patient’s pupils\\nare dilated with eye drops and he rests his chin and fore-\\nhead against a bracing apparatus to keep it still. Sodium\\nfluorescein dye is then injected with a syringe into a vein\\nin the patient’s arm. The dye will travel through the\\npatient’s body and into the blood vessels of the eye. The\\nprocedure does not require x rays. Instead, a rapid series\\nof close-up photographs of the patient’s eyes are taken,\\none set immediately after the dye is injected, and a sec-\\nond set approximately 20 minutes later once the dye has\\nmoved through the patient’s vascular system. The entire\\nprocedure takes up to one hour.\\nCeliac and mesenteric angiography\\nCeliac and mesenteric angiography involves x-ray\\nexploration of the celiac and mesenteric arteries, arterial\\nbranches of the abdominal aorta that supply blood to the\\nabdomen and digestive system. The test is commonly\\nused to detect aneurysm, thrombosis, and signs of\\nischemiain the celiac and mesenteric arteries, and to\\nlocate the source of gastrointestinal bleeding. It is also\\nused in the diagnosis of a number of conditions, includ-\\ning portal hypertension , and cirrhosis .

There\\nare various types of these procedures and their names are\\nassociated with the type of vessel entry and equipment\\nused. For example, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty\\n(PTA) describes entry through the skin (percutaneous) and\\nnavigates to the area of the vessel of interest through the\\nsame vessel or one that communicates with it (translumi-\\nnal). In the case of a procedure involving the coronary\\narteries, the point of entry could be the femoral artery in the\\ngroin and the catheter/guidewire system is passed through\\nthe aorta to the heart and the origin of the coronary arteries\\nat the base of the aorta just outside the aortic valve.\\nPurpose\\nIn individuals with an occulsive vascular disease\\nsuch as atherosclerosis , blood flow is impaired to an\\norgan (such as the heart) or to a distal body part ( such as\\nthe lower leg) by the narrowing of the vessel’s lumen due\\nto fatty deposits or calcium accumulation. This narrow-\\ning may occur in any vessel but may occur anywhere.\\nOnce the vessel has been widened, adequate blood flow\\nis returned. The vessel may narrow again over time at the\\nsame location and the procedure could be repeated.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2200\\nAngioplasty\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 200'),\n",

Administration of anticoagulants, however,\\nmay impede the sealing of the vascular entry point. The\\nprocedure will be performed using fluoroscopic guidance\\nand contrast media. Since the decision to perform angio-\\nplasty may have been made following a diagnostic\\nangiogram, the patient’s sensitivity to iodinated contrast\\nmedia is likely to known. The procedure may then\\nrequire the use of non-ionic contrast agents.\\nDescription\\nAngioplasty was originally performed by dilating the\\nvessel with the introduction of larger and larger stiff\\ncatheters through the narrowed space. Complications of\\nthis procedure caused researchers to develop means of\\nwidening the vessel using a minimally sized device.\\nToday, catheters contain balloons that are inflated to widen\\nthe vessel and stents to provide structural support for the\\nvessel. Lasers may be used to assist in the break up of the\\nfat or calcium plaque.

If a percutaneous transluminal coronary angio-\\nplasty (PTCA) is to be performed, the patient will be\\nkept awake to report on discomfort and cough if\\nrequired. PTCA procedures are performed in cardiac\\ncatheterization labs with sophisticated monitoring\\ndevices. If angioplasty is performed in the radiology\\ndepartment’s angiographic suite, the patient may be\\nsedated for the procedure and a nurse will monitor the\\npatient’s vital signs during the procedure.

Although many\\nprocedures are performed by puncturing the vessel\\nthrough skin, many procedures are also performed by\\nsurgically exposing the site of entry. Direct view of the\\nvessel’s puncture site aids in monitoring damage to the\\nvessel or excessive bleeding at the site. Once the vessel is\\npunctured and the guidewire is introduced, fluoroscopy\\nis used to monitor small injections of contrast media used\\nto visualize the path through the vessel.

Drugs that may cause decreased ACE levels\\ninclude ACE inhibitor antihypertensives and steroids.\\nDescription\\nACE plays an important role in the renin/aldosterone\\nmechanism which controls blood pressure by converting\\nangiotensin I to angiotensin II, two proteins involved in\\nregulating blood pressure. Angiotensin I by itself is inac-\\ntive, but when converted by ACE to the active form,\\nangiotensin II, it causes narrowing of the small blood\\nvessels in tissues, resulting in an increase in blood pres-\\nsure. Angiotensin II also stimulates the hormone aldos-\\nterone, which causes an increase in blood pressure. Cer-\\ntain kidney disorders increase the production of\\nangiotensin II, another cause of hypertension .

Flores\\nAnimal bite infections\\nDefinition\\nThe most common problem following an animal bite\\nis simple infection. The saliva of dogs and cats is known\\nto contain a wide variety of bacteria. According to one\\nrecent study, bacteria or other pathogens show up in\\nabout 85 percent of bites. When an animal bites, it can\\nthen transmit pathogens into the wound. These microor-\\nganisms may grow within the wound and cause an infec-\\ntion. The consequences of infection range from mild dis-\\ncomfort to life-threatening complications.\\nDescription\\nTwo to 4.5 million animal bites occur each year in\\nthe United States and about 1% of bites require hospital-\\nization. Animal bites result in 334,000 emergency room\\nvisits per year, which represents approximately 1% of all\\nemergency hospital visits, at an annual cost of $100 mil-\\nlion dollars in health care expenses and lost income.\\nKEY TERMS\\nSarcoidosis —Sarcoidosis is a rare disease of\\nunknown cause in which inflammation occurs in\\nlymph nodes and other tissues throughout the\\nbody, usually the lungs, skin, liver, and eyes.\\nChildren are the most frequent victims of dog bites, with\\n5-9 year-old boys having the highest incidence. Men are\\nmore often bitten by dogs than are women (3:1), whereas\\nwomen are more often bitten by cats (3:1).\\nDog bites make up 80-85% of all reported incidents.\\nCats account for about 10% of reported bites, and other\\nanimals (including rodents, rabbits, horses, raccoons,\\nbats, skunks, and monkeys) make up the remaining 5-\\n10%. Cat bites become infected more frequently than\\ndog bites. A dog’s mouth is rich in bacteria, but only 15-\\n20% of dog bites become infected. In contrast, approxi-\\nmately 30-50% of cat bites become infected.\\nMany factors contribute to the infection rates, such\\nas, for example, the type of wound inflicted, the location\\nof the wound, pre-existing health conditions in the bitten\\nperson, the extent of delay before treatment, patient com-\\npliance and the presence of a foreign body in the wound.\\nDogs usually inflict crush injuries because they have\\nrounded teeth and strong jaws; thus, the bite of an adult\\ndog can exert up to 200 pounds per square inch of pres-\\nsure. This pressure usually results in a crushing injury,\\ncausing damage to deep structures such as bones, blood\\nvessels, tendons, muscles, and nerves. Dog canine teeth\\nare also sharp and strong and also inflict lacerations.\\nCats, with their needle-like fangs, typically cause punc-\\nture wounds. Puncture wounds appear innocuous on the\\nsurface, but the underlying injury goes deep. Cat teeth\\nessentially inject bacteria into the bite, and the deep, nar-\\nrow wound is difficult to clean. Persons with impaired\\nimmunocompetence—for example, individuals with HIV\\ninfection—are especially vulnerable to infection.\\nThe bacterial species most commonly found in bite\\nwounds include Pasteurella multocida, Staphylococcus\\naureus, Pseudomonas sp, and Streptococcus sp. P . multoci-\\nda, the root cause of pasteurellosis, is especially prominent\\nin cat bite infections. Other infectious diseases from animal\\nbites include cat-scratch disease, tetanusand rabies.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe most common sign of infection from an animal\\nbite is inflammation. The skin around the wound is red\\nand feels warm, and the wound may exude pus. Nearby\\nlymph glands may be swollen. Complications can arise if\\nthe infection is not treated and spreads into deeper struc-\\ntures or into the bloodstream. If the bite is deep or occurs\\non the hand or at a joint, complications are more likely.\\nLive, disease-causing bacteria within the blood-\\nstream and tissues cause complications far from the\\nwound site. Such complications include meningitis ,\\nbrain abscesses, pneumonia and lung abscesses, and\\nheart infections, among others. These complications can\\nbe fatal. Deep bites or bites near joints can damage joints\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2206\\nAnimal bite infections\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 206'),\n",

Approximately\\n22,000 cases are reported each year in the United States;\\nworldwide, nine out of every 100,000 individuals\\nbecome infected. More than 80% of reported cases occur\\nin persons under the age of 21. The disease is not nor-\\nmally severe in individuals with healthy immune sys-\\ntems. Symptoms may become serious, however, in\\nimmunocompromised individuals, such as those with\\nacquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or those\\nundergoing chemotherapy. Common symptoms include\\nan inflamed sore in the area of the bite or scratch,\\nswollen lymph nodes,fever, fatigue, and rash.\\nRabies is caused by a virus that is transmitted through\\nthe bite of an animal that is already infected. More than\\n90% of animal rabies cases occur in wild animals such as\\nskunks, bats, and raccoons, with domestic animals such as\\ndogs and cats accounting for less than 10%. The World\\nHealth Organization (WHO) estimates that between\\n35,000 and 50,000 individuals worldwide die each year as\\na result of rabies. The highest incidence of rabies occurs in\\nAsia where, in 1997, over 33,000 deaths were noted, most\\noccurring in India. Rabies is nowadays rare in the U.S. due\\nto good animal control practice. The delay of onset is usu-\\nally weeks to months after being bitten. Early symptoms\\nof rabies include fever,headache, and flu-like symptoms.\\nThese progress to anxiety, hallucinations , muscle\\nspasms, partial paralysis, fear of water (hydrophobia), and\\nother neurological symptoms as the virus spreads to the\\ncentral nervous system. Medical treatment must be sought\\nsoon after exposure because death invariably follows once\\nthe infection becomes established.\\nDiagnosis\\nA medical examination involves taking the history of\\nthe injury and assessing the wound type and damage.\\nTetanus immunization and general health status are\\nchecked. An x ray may be ordered to assess bone damage\\nand to check for foreign objects in the wound. Wound\\ncultures are done for infected bites if the victim is at high\\nrisk for complications or if the infection does not respond\\nto treatment. Evaluation of possible exposure to rabies is\\nalso important. A biting animal suspected of having rabies\\nis usually apprehended, tested, and observed for a period\\nof time for evidence of pre-existing infection.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment depends on the wound type, its site, and\\nrisk factors for infection. All wounds are cleaned and dis-\\ninfected as thoroughly as possible. Bites to the head and\\nface usually receive sutures, as do severe lacerations\\nelsewhere. Puncture wounds are left open. If abscess for-\\nmation occurs, the physician may perform an incision so\\nas to drain the abscess.\\nIf infection occurs, antibiotics are prescribed.\\nAntibiotics may also be used for infection prevention.\\nSince a single bite wound may contain many different\\ntypes of bacteria, no single antibiotic is always effective.\\nCommonly prescribed antibiotics are penicillin or a com-\\nbination of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium.\\nBecause rabies is caused by a virus, antibiotics are\\nnot effective. In addition, as of 2001, there is no known\\ncure for the disease once symptoms become apparent.

It has\\nmany sensory nerves and is sensitive to pain. The rectum\\nis the last section of the digestive tract and has a mucus\\nlayer as its inside surface. It has very few sensory nerves\\nand is, therefore, relatively insensitive to pain. The anal\\ncanal has a ring of muscle, called the anal sphincter,\\nwhich keeps the anus closed.

They may become inflamed,\\nenlarged, or protrude from the anorectal area. Hemor-\\nrhoids may bleed when passing a bowel movement. The\\namount of bleeding is typically small. Frequently, hem-\\norrhoids develop because of straining during bowel\\nmovements, especially if the person has constipation.\\nAn anal fissure is a tear in the lining of the anus that\\nis usually caused by a hard bowel movement. Fissures\\nare painful and bleed when the tissue is stressed during\\nbowel movements.\\nAnorectal abscesses are characterized by pus-form-\\ning infections in the anorectal region. Painful abscesses\\nform under the skin.\\nAn anorectal fistula is an abnormal opening or chan-\\nnel from the anorectal area to another part of the body.\\nTypically, the channel leads to pockets of skin near the\\nanus. When seen in infants, anorectal fistulas are consid-\\nered birth defects . These are seen more frequently in\\nboys than in girls. Fistulas are also seen more frequently\\nin people who have other diseases, including Crohn’s\\ndisease, tuberculosis, cancer, and diverticulitis. Anorec-\\ntal fistulas also occur following anorectal abscesses or\\nother injury to the anal area. Fistulas are usually painful\\nand discharge pus.\\nProctitis is an inflammation of the internal mucosal\\nlining of the rectum. Ulcers of the lining may form and\\ndevelop into ulcerative colitis. There are many causes of\\nproctitis, including the sexually transmitted diseases\\nchlamydia and herpes simplex infections. Proctitis is fre-\\nquently seen in homosexual males as a consequence of\\nanorectal infection. Proctitis itself is not painful, but pain\\nmay be caused by the infectious agent.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is made by visual inspection of the skin\\naround the anus. Also, the doctor may probe the rectum\\nwith a gloved finger. An anoscope is a short instrument\\nthat allows the physician to view the inside of the anus.

The name comes\\nfrom two Latin words that mean nervous inability to eat.\\nIn females who have begun to menstruate, anorexia ner-\\nvosa is usually marked by amenorrhea , or skipping at\\nleast three menstrual periods in a row. The fourth edition\\nof the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis-\\norders, or DSM-IV (1994), defines two subtypes of\\nanorexia nervosa—a restricting type, characterized by\\nstrict dieting and exercise without binge eating; and a\\nbinge-eating/purging type, marked by episodes of com-\\npulsive eating with or without self-induced vomiting and\\nthe use of laxatives or enemas. DSM-IV defines a binge\\nas a time-limited (usually under two hours) episode of\\ncompulsive eating in which the individual consumes a\\nsignificantly larger amount of food than most people\\nwould eat in similar circumstances.\\nDescription\\nAnorexia nervosa was not officially classified as a\\npsychiatric disorder until the third edition of DSM in\\n1980. It is, however, a growing problem among adoles-\\ncent females. Its incidence in the United States has dou-\\nbled since 1970. The rise in the number of reported cases\\nreflects a genuine increase in the number of persons\\naffected by the disorder, and not simply earlier or more\\naccurate diagnosis. Estimates of the incidence of anorex-\\nia range between 0.5–1% of caucasian female adoles-\\ncents. Over 90% of patients diagnosed with the disorder\\nas of 1998 are female. It was originally thought that only\\n5% of anorexics are male, but that estimate is being\\nrevised upward. The peak age range for onset of the dis-\\norder is 14-18 years, although there are patients who\\ndevelop anorexia as late as their 40s. In the 1970s and\\n1980s, anorexia was regarded as a disorder of upper- and\\nmiddle-class women, but that generalization is also\\nchanging. More recent studies indicate that anorexia is\\nincreasingly common among women of all races and\\nsocial classes in the United States.\\nAnorexia nervosa is a serious public health problem\\nnot only because of its rising incidence, but also because\\nit has one of the highest mortality rates of any psychiatric\\ndisorder. Moreover, the disorder may cause serious long-\\nterm health complications, including congestive heart\\nfailure, sudden death, growth retardation, dental prob-\\nlems, constipation , stomach rupture, swelling of the\\nsalivary glands, anemia and other abnormalities of the\\nblood, loss of kidney function, and osteoporosis.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAnorexia is a disorder that results from the interac-\\ntion of cultural and interpersonal as well as biological\\nfactors. While the precise cause of the disease is not\\nknown, it has been linked to the following:\\nSocial influences\\nThe rising incidence of anorexia is thought to reflect\\nthe present idealization of thinness as a badge of upper-\\nclass status as well as of female beauty. In addition, the\\nincrease in cases of anorexia includes “copycat” behav-\\nior, with some patients developing the disorder from imi-\\ntating other girls.\\nThe onset of anorexia in adolescence is attributed to\\na developmental crisis caused by girls’ changing bodies\\ncoupled with society’s overemphasis on women’s looks.\\nThe increasing influence of the mass media in spreading\\nand reinforcing gender stereotypes has also been noted.\\nOccupational goals\\nThe risk of developing anorexia is higher among\\nadolescents preparing for careers that require attention to\\nweight and/or appearance.

No single\\nexplanation covers all cases. Anorexia nervosa has been\\ninterpreted as:\\n• A rejection of female sexual maturity. This rejection is\\nvariously interpreted as a desire to remain a child, or as\\na desire to resemble men as closely as possible.\\n• A reaction to sexual abuse or assault.\\n• A desire to appear as fragile and nonthreatening as pos-\\nsible. This hypothesis reflects the idea that female pas-\\nsivity and weakness are attractive to men.\\n• Overemphasis on control, autonomy, and indepen-\\ndence. Some anorexics come from achievement-orient-\\ned families that stress physical fitness and dieting.\\nMany anorexics are perfectionistic and “driven” about\\nschoolwork and other matters in addition to weight\\ncontrol.\\n• Evidence of family dysfunction. In some families, a\\ndaughter’s eating disorder serves as a distraction from\\nmarital discord or other family tensions.\\n• Inability to interpret the body’s hunger signals accu-\\nrately due to early experiences of inappropriate feeding.\\nMale anorexics\\nAlthough anorexia nervosa is still considered a dis-\\norder that largely affects women, its incidence in the\\nmale population is rising. Less is known about the causes\\nof anorexia in males, but some risk factors are the same\\nas for females. These include certain occupational goals\\nand increasing media emphasis on external appearance in\\nmen. Moreover, homosexual males are under pressure to\\nconform to an ideal body weight that is about 20 pounds\\nlighter than the standard “attractive” weight for hetero-\\nsexual males.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of anorexia nervosa is complicated by a\\nnumber of factors. One is that the disorder varies some-\\nwhat in severity from patient to patient. A second factor\\nis denial, which is regarded as an early sign of the disor-\\nder. Most anorexics deny that they are ill and are usually\\nbrought to treatment by a family member.\\nMost anorexics are diagnosed by pediatricians or\\nfamily practitioners. Anorexics develop emaciated bod-\\nies, dry or yellowish skin, and abnormally low blood\\npressure. There is usually a history of amenorrhea (fail-\\nure to menstruate) in females, and sometimes of abdomi-\\nnal pain, constipation, or lack of energy. The patient may\\nfeel chilly or have developed lanugo, a growth of downy\\nbody hair. If the patient has been vomiting, she may have\\neroded tooth enamel or Russell’s sign (scars on the back\\nof the hand). The second step in diagnosis is measure-\\nment of the patient’s weight loss. DSM-IV specifies a\\nweight loss leading to a body weight 15% below normal,\\nwith some allowance for body build and weight history.\\nThe doctor will need to rule out other physical condi-\\ntions that can cause weight loss or vomiting after eating,\\nincluding metabolic disorders, brain tumors (especially\\nhypothalamus and pituitary gland lesions), diseases of the\\ndigestive tract, and a condition called superior mesenteric\\nartery syndrome. Persons with this condition sometimes\\nvomit after meals because the blood supply to the intes-\\ntine is blocked. The doctor will usually order blood tests,\\nan electrocardiogram,urinalysis, and bone densitometry\\n(bone density test) in order to exclude other diseases and\\nto assess the patient’s nutritional status.\\nThe doctor will also need to distinguish between\\nanorexia and other psychiatric disorders, including depres-\\nsion,schizophrenia, social phobia,obsessive-compulsive\\ndisorder, and body dysmorphic disorder. Two diagnostic\\ntests that are often used are the Eating Attitudes Test\\n(EAT) and the Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI).\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of anorexia nervosa includes both short-\\nand long-term measures, and requires assessment by\\ndietitians and psychiatrists as well as medical specialists.\\nTherapy is often complicated by the patient’s resistance\\nor failure to carry out treatment plan.\\nHospital treatment\\nHospitalization is recommended for anorexics with\\nany of the following characteristics:\\n• weight of 40% or more below normal; or weight loss\\nover a three-month period of more than 30 pounds\\n• severely disturbed metabolism\\n• severe binging and purging\\n• signs of psychosis\\n• severe depression or risk of suicide\\n• family in crisis\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2212\\nAnorectal disorders\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 212'),\n",

Frey\\nAnoscopy\\nDefinition\\nAn anoscopy is an examination of the rectum in\\nwhich a small tube is inserted into the anus to screen, diag-\\nnose, and evaluate problems of the anus and anal canal.\\nPurpose\\nThis test may be ordered for the evaluation of peri-\\nanal or anal pain, hemorrhoids, rectal prolapse, digital\\nrectal examination that shows a mass, perianal abscess\\nand condyloma (a wart-like growth). An anascopy may\\nbe performed to check for abnormal openings between\\nthe anus and the skin, or anal fissures. The test is also\\nused to diagnose rectal cancer.\\nPrecautions\\nAnoscopy should not be performed on patients with\\nacute cardiovascular problems due to the vasovagal reac-\\ntion it may cause. This test is also not recommended for\\npatients with acute abdominal problems and those with a\\nconstricted or narrowed anal canal.\\nDescription\\nAnoscopy views the anus and anal canal by using an\\nanoscope. An anoscope is a plastic, tube-shaped specu-\\nlum that is a smaller version of a sigmoidscope. Before\\nthe anoscope is used, the doctor completes a digital rectal\\nexamination with a lubricated, gloved index finger. The\\nanoscope is then lubricated and gently inserted a few\\ninches into the rectum. This procedure enlarges the rec-\\ntum to allow the doctor to view the entire anal canal with\\na light. If any suspicious areas are noticed, a piece of tis-\\nsue can be biopsied.\\nDuring the anoscopy procedure there may be a feel-\\ning of pressure or the need to go to the bathroom. If a\\nbiopsy is taken, the patient may feel a slight pinch. The\\nprocedure is performed on an out-patient basis, and takes\\napproximately an hour to complete.\\nPreparation\\nThe patient will be instructed to clear their rectum of\\nstool before the procedure. This may be done by taking a\\nKEY TERMS\\nAnal fissure—An ulcer on the margin of the anus.\\nDigital rectal examination —An examination\\nwhere a gloved, lubricated index finger is inserted\\ninto the rectum to check for any abnormalities.\\nPolyps—A tumor with a small flap that attaches\\nitself to the wall of various vascular organs such as\\nthe nose, uterus and rectum.

Kapes\\nAnosmia\\nDefinition\\nThe term anosmia means lack of the sense of smell.\\nIt may also refer to a decreased sense of smell. Ageusia, a\\ncompanion word, refers to a lack of taste sensation.\\nPatients who actually have anosmia may complain\\nwrongly of ageusia, although they retain the ability to\\ndistinguish salt, sweet, sour, and bitter—humans’ only\\ntaste sensations.\\nDescription\\nOf the five senses, smell ranks fourth in importance\\nfor humans, although it is much more pronounced in\\nother animals. Bloodhounds, for example, can smell an\\nodor a thousand times weaker than humans. Taste, consid-\\nered the fifth sense, is mostly the smell of food in the\\nmouth. The sense of smell originates from the first cranial\\nnerves (the olfactory nerves), which sit at the base of the\\nbrain’s frontal lobes, right behind the eyes and above the\\nnose. Inhaled airborne chemicals stimulate these nerves.\\nThere are other aberrations of smell beside a\\ndecrease. Smells can be distorted, intensified, or halluci-\\nnated. These changes usually indicate a malfunction of\\nthe brain.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe most common cause of anosmia is nasal occlu-\\nsion caused by rhinitis (inflammation of the nasal mem-\\nbranes). If no air gets to the olfactory nerves, smell will\\nnot happen. In turn, rhinitis and nasal polyps (growths\\non nasal membranes) are caused by irritants such as\\nallergens, infections, cigarette smoke, and other air pol-\\nlutants. Tumors such as nasal polyps can also block the\\nnasal passages and the olfactory nerves and cause anos-\\nmia. Head injury or, rarely, certain viral infections can\\ndamage or destroy the olfactory nerves.\\nDiagnosis\\nIt is difficult to measure a loss of smell, and no one\\ncomplains of loss of smell in just one nostril. So a physi-\\ncian usually begins by testing each nostril separately\\nwith a common, non-irritating odor such as perfume,\\nlemon, vanilla, or coffee. Polyps and rhinitis are obvious\\ncausal agents a physician looks for. Imaging studies of\\nthe head may be necessary in order to detect brain injury,\\nsinus infection, or tumor.\\nTreatment\\nCessation of smoking is the first step. Many smok-\\ners who quit discover new tastes so enthusiastically that\\nthey immediately gain weight. Attention to reducing\\nexposure to other nasal irritants and treatment of respira-\\ntory allergies or chronic upper respiratory infections will\\nbe beneficial. Corticosteroids are particularly helpful.\\nAlternative treatment\\nFinding and treating the cause of the loss of smell is\\nthe first approach in naturopathic medicine . If rhinitis\\nis the cause, treating acute rhinitis with herbal mast cell\\nstabilizers and herbal decongestants can offer some\\nrelief as the body heals. If chronic rhinitis is present, this\\nis often related to an environmental irritant or to food\\nallergies. Removal of the causative factors is the first step\\nto healing. Nasal steams with essential oils offer relief of\\nthe blockage and tonification of the membranes. Block-\\nages can sometimes be resolved through naso-specific\\ntherapy—a way of realigning the nasal cavities. Polyp\\nblockage can be addressed through botanical medicine\\ntreatment as well as hydrotherapy . Olfactory nerve\\ndamage may not be regenerable. Some olfactory aberra-\\ntions, like intensified sense of smell, can be resolved\\nusing homeopathic medicine.\\nPrognosis\\nIf nasal inflammation is the cause of anosmia, the\\nchances of recovery are excellent. However, if nerve\\ndamage is the cause of the problem, the recovery of smell\\nis much more difficult.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBennett, J. Claude, and Fred Plum, eds. Cecil Textbook of Med-\\nicine.

Ricker Polsdorfer, MD\\nAnoxemia see Anoxia\\nAnoxia\\nDefinition\\nAnoxia is a condition characterized by an absence of\\noxygen supply to an organ or a tissue.\\nDescription\\nAnoxia results when oxygen is not being delivered to\\na part of the body. If the condition does not involve total\\noxygen deprivation, it is often called hypoxia, although\\nthe two terms have been used interchangeably. A related\\ncondition, anoxemia, occurs when the blood circulates\\nbut contains a below normal amount of oxygen.\\nThe five types of anoxia or hypoxia include hypox-\\nemic, anemic, affinity, stagnant, and histotoxic. Hypox-\\nemic anoxia happens when the oxygen pressure outside\\nthe body is so low that the hemoglobin, the chemical\\nwhich carries oxygen in the red blood cells (RBCs), is\\nunable to become fully loaded with the gas. This results in\\ntoo little oxygen reaching the tissues and can occur in suf-\\nfocation when a person is at high altitude, where the pres-\\nsure of oxygen in the air is much less than at sea level.\\nAnemic anoxia results from a decrease in the\\namount of hemoglobin or RBCs in the blood, which\\nreduces the ability to get oxygen to the tissues. Anemia\\nmay result from lack of production of red blood cells\\nKEY TERMS\\nAllergen—Any substance that irritates only those\\nwho are sensitive (allergic) to it.\\nCorticosteroids —Cortisone, prednisone, and\\nrelated drugs that reduce inflammation.\\nRhinitis—Inflammation and swelling of the nasal\\nmembranes.\\nNasal polyps —Drop-shaped overgrowths of the\\nnasal membranes.\\n(iron deficiency), blood loss (hemorrhage), or shortened\\nlifespan of red blood cells (autoimmune disease).\\nAffinity anoxia involves a defect in the chemistry of\\nthe blood such that the hemoglobin can no longer pick up\\nas much oxygen from the air, even though the quantities\\nare normal, reducing how much is delivered to the tissues.\\nStagnant anoxia occurs when there is interference\\nwith the blood flow, although the blood and its oxygen-\\ncarrying abilities are normal. A common cause of general\\nstagnant anoxia is heart disease or interference with the\\nreturn of blood flow through the veins. Examples of local\\nstagnant anoxia include exposure to cold, diseases that\\nrestrict circulation to the extremities, and ergot poison-\\ning. When the tissue or organ itself has a reduced ability\\nto accept and use the oxygen, it is called histotoxic anox-\\nia. The classic example is cyanide poisoning, where the\\nchemical inactivates a cellular enzyme necessary for the\\ncell to use oxygen. Thus, tissue exposed to cyanide can-\\nnot use the oxygen even though it is in normal amounts\\nin the bloodstream. Histotoxic anoxia can also be caused\\nby exposure to narcotics, alcohol, formaldehyde, ace-\\ntone, toluene, and certain anesthetic agents.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAnoxia and hypoxia can be caused by any number of\\ndisease states of the blood, lungs, heart and circulation\\nincluding heart attack, severe asthma, or emphysema.\\nIt can also result from smoke or carbon monoxide inhala-\\ntion, improper exposure to anesthesia, poisoning, strangu-\\nlation,near-drowning, or high altitude exposure through\\nmountain climbing or travel in an insufficiently pressur-\\nized airplane. Anoxia, and the resultant brain damage, is a\\nparticular problem with newborns during difficult births.\\nNo matter what the cause of anoxia, the symptoms\\nare similar. In severe cases, the patient is often confused\\nand commonly stuperous or comatose (in a state of\\nunconsciousness). Depending on the severity of the injury\\nto the brain, the organ most sensitive to reduced oxygen\\nintake, this condition can persist for hours, days, weeks,\\nor even months or years. Seizures, myoclonic jerks (invol-\\nuntary muscle spasms or twitches), and neck stiffness are\\nsome other symptoms of the anoxic condition.\\nSymptoms of more localized or less complete oxygen\\ndeprivation (hypoxia) include increased breathing rate,\\nlightheadedness,dizziness, tingling or warm sensation,\\nsweating, reduced field of vision, sleepiness, a bluish tint\\nto skin, particularly the fingertips and lips, and behavior\\nchanges, often an inappropriate sense of euphoria.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of anoxia and hypoxia is commonly made\\nthrough the appearance of clinical symptoms.

The exact test that is\\nperformed is dependent on the suspected cause of the\\nanoxia. One systemic measure of tissue anoxia is the\\nserum lactate (lactic acid) test. When cells are forced to\\nproduce energy without oxygen, as would happen during\\nanoxia, lactic acid is one of the byproducts. Thus, an\\nincrease in lactic acid in the blood would indicate that tis-\\nsues were starved for oxygen and are using non-oxygen\\npathways to produce energy. Normally, the blood con-\\ntains less than 2mmol/L of lactic acid. However, some\\nforms of anoxia do not increase lactic acid concentrations\\nin the blood and some increases in lactic acid levels are\\nnot associated with anoxia, so an elevated value for this\\ntest is only suggestive of an anoxic or hypoxic condition.\\nTreatment\\nThe exact treatment for anoxia is dependent on the\\ncause of the reduced oxygen reaching the tissues. How-\\never, immediate restoration of tissue oxygen levels\\nthrough supplementing the patient’s air supply with\\n100% oxygen is a common first step.

If cardio-\\nvascular and respiratory systems can be supported ade-\\nquately, recovery from the injury to the tissue is possible,\\nalthough extent of injury to the brain can be difficult to\\nassess. The exact amount of recovery varies with the\\namount of injury sustained, where significant injury brings\\na poorer prognosis.

Later, the focus shifts to checking on\\nfetal well-being with a variety of technological tools\\nsuch as ultrasound scans.

In certain cases, the technician may insert a\\nplastic probe into the woman’s vaginal canal to get a\\nclearer picture of the fetus. Early in pregnancy, the test\\nmay need to be done with a full bladder.\\nUnlike x rays, ultrasound is safe to use during preg-\\nnancy. It does not cause any known side-effects that\\nwould harm the mother or baby.\\nPregnant women usually will have their first ultra-\\nsound anytime between 8 and 12 weeks of gestation. In\\nnormal cases, the technician is able to identify a fetal\\nheartbeat, which appears as a flashing light on the screen.\\nCloser to the due date, physicians use ultrasound to make\\nsure the fetus is in the correct position to exit the birth\\ncanal head first.\\nSometimes an ultrasound will show that a fetus has\\nstopped growing, or a gestational sac has formed without\\na fetus, and a miscarriage has occurred. Later in pregnan-\\ncy, it also may show that the child is in a breech position,\\noriented feet first, which can cause a difficult labor.\\nTests for birth defects\\nMost obstetricians offer parents a variety of ways to\\nfind out if their developing child might have birth\\ndefects such as spina bifida and Down Syndrome . An\\nalpha fetoprotein screen can be done through a simple\\nblood test in the doctor’s office between the 16th and\\n18th week of gestation. It tells the odds that their child\\nwill have a severe congenital anomaly. The test works by\\nmeasuring the level of alpha fetoprotein, a substance pro-\\nduced by a fetus with birth defects. Low levels of alpha\\nfetoprotein in the mother’s blood may indicate Down’s\\nSyndrome. In that case, the next step for most couples is\\namniocentesisbecause the alpha fetoprotein test can\\ngive false-positive results. Amniocentesis is a more accu-\\nrate test, but it also has higher risks of complications.\\nThis procedure typically is used to diagnose Down\\nsyndrome while a developing child is still in the womb,\\nat 15-28 weeks.\\nDuring amniocentesis, a doctor inserts a needle\\nthrough a woman’s vaginal canal and inside her cervix.\\nUsing ultrasound as a guide, the doctor pierces the uterus\\nto withdraw a sample of fluid from the amniotic sac.\\nAfterwards, tiny cells shed by the fetus can be studied in\\nthe laboratory. Scientists can analyze DNA samples to\\ndetermine if the fetus has Down syndrome or other\\ngenetic conditions. Amniocentesis also can determine the\\nsex of the fetus.\\nWomen who have a history of recurring miscar-\\nriages may not want to have this procedure.\\nAmniocentesis is usually performed in a doctor’s\\noffice on an outpatient basis.\\nCommon side effects include cramping and bleeding.\\nIn about one out of every 1,000 cases, amniocentesis\\ncauses a needle to puncture the uterine wall, which could\\nresult in miscarriage.\\nIn most cases, couples find out their baby does not\\nhave a birth defect.\\nIf the results come back positive for Down’s Syn-\\ndrome or other serious conditions, the couple must\\ndecide if they want to end the pregnancy. Others use the\\nknowledge to plan and prepare any special care needed\\nfor their future child.\\nGroup B Strep\\nThis test is for Group B streptococci (GBS) infection.\\nBy testing for GBS, physicians can determine if a\\nwoman is at risk of passing this infection along to her child.\\nWomen who have had a prior child with GBS, or\\nwho have a fever or prolonged or premature rupture of\\nthe amniotic sac may be at higher risk for this type of\\ninfection.\\nGBS is a type of bacteria commonly found in the\\nvagina and rectum. Unlike regular strep throat , GBS\\ncan be present in a person’s body without causing any\\nsymptoms, so many women do not realize they are\\ninfected with it.\\nTo test for the presence of GBS, doctors may take a\\nurine sample. They also may collect samples from the\\nvagina or rectum, which are then analyzed in a lab. This\\ntest is usually performed late in pregnancy, at 35-37\\nweeks of gestation.\\nThis is a routine urine test or pelvic exam with no\\nside effects.\\nIn many cases, doctors do not find any evidence of\\nthis type of infection.\\nIf a woman is found to be infected with Group B\\nstrep, physicians usually wait to treat it until just before\\nlabor begins. At that time, they may give the mother\\nantibioticsso the baby is not born with the infection.\\nNewborns who are exposed to Group B strep can have\\ninflammation of the brain, spinal cord, blood or lungs.\\nIn some cases, this serious complication can result in\\ninfant death.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nEisenberg, Arlene, et al.

The results reflect the adequa-\\ncy of blood flow (and oxygen delivery) to the fetus from\\nthe placenta.\\nAntepartum tests are usually done in pregnancies at\\nhigh risk for fetal complications. Various reasons\\ninclude:\\n• any chronic illness in the mother, such as high blood\\npressure or diabetes\\n• problems with previous pregnancies, such as stillbirth\\n• fetal complications, such as intrauterine growth retar-\\ndation (a slowing of growth of the fetus) or birth defects\\n• problems in the current pregnancy, including pre-\\neclampsia (serious pregnancy-induced high blood pres-\\nsure), gestational (pregnancy-related) diabetes, prema-\\nture rupture of the membranes, excessive amniotic fluid\\n(the liquid that surrounds the fetus), vaginal bleeding,\\nor placenta previa (a condition in which the placenta is\\npositioned over the cervix instead of near the top of the\\nuterus)\\n• twins or other multiple fetuses\\nOne of the most common indications for antepartum\\ntesting is post-term pregnancy. A pregnancy should not\\nbe allowed to continue past 42 weeks. (The usual preg-\\nnancy is 40 weeks in duration). Babies should be moni-\\ntored with antepartum testing starting at 41 weeks. After\\n41 weeks, there is an increasing risk that the placenta\\ncannot meet the growing baby’s needs for oxygen and\\nnutrition. This may be reflected in decreased move-\\nments of the baby, decreased amniotic fluid, and changes\\nin the heart rate pattern of the baby.\\nDescription\\nTechnology\\nThe NST and CST use a technique called electronic\\nfetal monitoring to evaluate the heartbeat of the fetus.\\nThe biophysical profile is an ultrasound examination.\\nNST\\nThe NST is usually the first antepartum test used to\\nverify fetal well-being.

To\\nrecord fetal movements on the tracing, the mother press-\\nes a button every time she feels the baby move. If the\\nbaby is inactive, the mother may be asked to rub her\\nabdomen to “awaken” it. Sometimes an instrument is\\nused to produce a loud noise to arouse the fetus (vibroa-\\ncoustic stimulation). The test usually takes between\\n20–45 minutes.\\nA baby who is receiving enough oxygen should\\nmove at least twice in a 20 minute period. The baby’s\\nheart rate should increase at least 20 beats per minute for\\nat least 20 seconds during these movements. The NST is\\nthe simplest and cheapest antepartum test.\\nBiophysical profile\\nThe biophysical profile is an ultrasound exam that\\ncan add additional information to the NST. During the\\nbiophysical profile, the examiner checks for various\\ncharacteristics of the baby to evaluate its overall health.\\nThese include: fetal movement, fetal tone, breathing\\nmovements, and the amniotic fluid volume. Amniotic\\nfluid volume is important because a decreased amount\\nraises the possibility that the baby may be under stress.\\nThe five components of the test (NST is also included)\\nare each given a score of 2 for normal (or present), 1 if\\ndecreased, and 0 for abnormal. The highest possible\\nscore is 10. The “modified” biophysical profile is\\nanother option; this includes only the NST and amniotic\\nfluid volume.\\nCST\\nThe CST is like the NST, except that the fetus is\\nevaluated in response to contractions of the mother’s\\nuterus. Because it is a more complicated test, it is often\\nused after an abnormal NST to confirm the results. Uter-\\nine contractions produce “stress” in the fetus because\\nthey temporarily stop the flow of blood and oxygen. The\\nCST is used to confirm that the fetus does not respond to\\nthis stress by a decrease in the heart rate.\\nThe CST is performed with the same equipment as\\nthe NST. Maternal blood pressure and fetal heart rate are\\nrecorded along with the onset, relative intensity, and\\nduration of any spontaneous contractions. For an accu-\\nrate test, the contractions should be of sufficient duration\\nand frequency. If uterine activity does not occur natural-\\nly, a drug called oxytocin may be given to the mother\\nintravenously (hence the test’s alternate name, the oxy-\\ntocin challenge test) to provoke contractions. Another\\noption is self-stimulation of the mother’s nipples,\\nbecause this releases natural oxytocin. The fetal heart\\nrate is observed until, ideally, three moderate contrac-\\ntions occur within 10 minutes.\\nPreparation\\nThe mother should eat just before the antepartum\\ntests to help stimulate fetal activity.\\nRisks\\nThere are no appreciable risks from the NST or the\\nbiophysical profile. Ultrasound used for the biophysical\\nprofile is painless and safe because it uses no harmful\\nradiation, and no evidence has been found that sound\\nwaves cause any adverse effects on the mother or fetus.\\nThe frequency of antepartum testing depends on the\\nreason for its use. All of the tests occasionally give incor-\\nrect results, which may prompt an unnecessary early\\ndelivery or cesarean. Repeat testing is important to dou-\\nble-check any abnormal findings.\\nNormal results\\nIn general, “negative” or normal results on antepar-\\ntum testing provide reassurance that the baby is healthy\\nand should remain so for perhaps a week, with no need\\nfor immediate delivery. Unfortunately, the tests cannot\\nguarantee that there are no problems, because falsely\\nnormal results can occur, though this is unusual. Even if\\nall test results are normal, it is important to realize that\\nthis does not guarantee a “perfect” baby.\\nThe NST is normal (“reactive”) if two or more dis-\\ntinct fetal movements occur in association with appropri-\\nate accelerations of the fetal heart rate within 20 minutes.\\nA biophysical profile score of 8-10 is considered reassur-\\ning. The CST is normal if the fetus shows no decelera-\\ntions in heart rate in response to three uterine contrac-\\ntions within 10 minutes.\\nAbnormal results\\nA “positive” result suggests that the baby is not\\nreceiving enough oxygen for some reason. However, it is\\nquite possible that the test result was falsely abnormal.\\nTo confirm or monitor a suspected disorder, follow-up\\ntesting with the same or an alternate test will probably be\\nperformed at least weekly.\\nThe NST is abnormal (“nonreactive”) if the fetal\\nheart rate fails to speed up by at least 20 beats per minute\\nat least two times during a 20-minute period. Abnormal\\ndecreases in the heart rate (decelerations) are also a cause\\nfor concern.\\nA biophysical profile score of 6 is considered a\\ncause for concern and should be followed by further test-\\ning. Scores of 4 or less may require immediate delivery\\nof the fetus.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2222\\nAntepartum testing\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 222'),\n",

In humans, the infection can often be\\ntreated, but it is almost always fatal in animals.\\nDescription\\nAnthrax is most often found in the agricultural\\nareas of South and Central America, southern and east-\\nern Europe, Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, and the Middle\\nEast. In the United States, anthrax is rarely reported,\\nhowever, cases of animal infection with anthrax are\\nmost often reported in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi,\\nOklahoma, and South Dakota. The bacterium and its\\nassociated disease get their name from the Greek word\\nmeaning “coal” because of the characteristic coal-black\\nsore that is the hallmark of the most common form of\\nthe disease.\\nDuring the 1800s, in England and Germany, anthrax\\nwas known either as “wool-sorter’s” or “ragpicker’s” dis-\\nease because workers contracted the disease from bacter-\\nial spores present on hides and in wool or fabric fibers.\\nSpores are the small, thick-walled dormant stage of some\\nbacteria that enable them to survive for long periods of\\ntime under adverse conditions. The first anthrax vaccine\\nwas perfected in 1881 by Louis Pasteur.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 223\\nAnthrax\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 223'),\n",

Four of the five patients\\nwith the pulmonary form of the disease died. Other cases\\nappeared in the 1970s when contaminated goatskin\\ndrumheads from Haiti were brought into this country as\\nsouvenirs. Today, anthrax is rare, even among cattle,\\nlargely because of widespread animal vaccination. How-\\never, some serious epidemics continue to occur among\\nanimal herds and in human settlements in developing\\ncountries due to ineffective control programs.\\nThere has been a great deal of recent concern that\\nthe bacteria that causes anthrax may be used by some\\ncountries as a type of biological warfare, since it is possi-\\nble to become infected simply by breathing in the spores.\\nThe largest-ever documented outbreak of human anthrax\\ncontracted through spore inhalation occurred in Russia in\\n1979, when anthrax spores were released from a military\\nlaboratory, causing a regional epidemic that killed 69 of\\nits 77 victims. Because the United States government\\nconsiders anthrax to be of potential risk to soldiers, the\\nDepartment of Defense has begun systematic vaccination\\nof all military personnel against anthrax, and other\\nnations, such as Britain, are rapidly following suit.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAnthrax is caused by the bacterium Bacillus\\nanthracis , which produces spores that can remain dor-\\nmant for years in soil and on animal products, such as\\nhides, wool, hair, or bones. The disease is often fatal to\\ncattle, sheep, and goats, and their hides, wool, and bones\\nare often heavily contaminated.\\nToday, in humans, the disease is almost always an\\noccupational hazard, contracted by those who handle\\nanimal hides (farmers, butchers, and veterinarians) or\\nsort wool. It is also possible to become infected with\\nanthrax by eating meat from contaminated animals.\\nThere are no reports of the disease spreading from one\\nperson to another.\\nSymptoms vary depending on how the disease was\\ncontracted, but the symptoms usually appear within one\\nweek of exposure.\\nCutaneous anthrax\\nIn humans, anthrax usually occurs when the bacteria\\nenter a cut or abrasion, causing a skin (cutaneous) infec-\\ntion at the site. Cutaneous anthrax, as this infection is\\ncalled, is the mildest form of the disease. At first, the\\nbacteria cause an itchy, raised area like an insect bite.\\nWithin one to two days, inflammation occurs around the\\nraised area, and a blister forms around an area of dying\\ntissue that becomes black in the center. Other symptoms\\nmay include shivering and chills. In most cases the bacte-\\nria remain within the sore. If, however, they spread to the\\nnearest lymph node (or, in rare cases, escape into the\\nbloodstream), the bacteria can cause a form of blood poi-\\nsoning that rapidly proves fatal.\\nInhalation anthrax\\nInhaling the bacteria or bacterial spores can lead to a\\nrare, fatal form of anthrax known as pulmonary or\\ninhalation anthrax that attacks the lungs and sometimes\\nspreads to the brain. Inhalation anthrax begins with flu-\\nlike symptoms, namely fever, fatigue , headache , and\\nshortness of breath , but progresses to bronchitis, dur-\\ning which time it becomes difficult to breathe, and final-\\nly, the patient enters a state of shock. This rare form of\\nanthrax is usually fatal, even if treated within one or two\\ndays after the symptoms appear.\\nIntestinal anthrax\\nIntestinal anthrax is a rare, often-fatal form of the dis-\\nease, caused by eating meat from an animal that died of\\nanthrax. Intestinal anthrax causes stomach and intestinal\\ninflammation and sores or lesions (ulcers), much like the\\nsores that appear on the skin in the cutaneous form of\\nanthrax. The first signs of the disease are nausea and\\nvomiting, loss of appetite, and fever, followed by abdomi-\\nnal pain, vomiting of blood, and severe bloody diarrhea.\\nDiagnosis\\nAnthrax is diagnosed by detecting B. anthracis in\\nsamples taken from blood, skin lesions , or respiratory\\nsecretions.

Other commonly used antibiotics, such as ery-\\nthromycin, tetracycline, or chloramphenicol, are also effec-\\ntive, particularly for those individuals who are allergic to\\npenicillin. Although not proven, it is thought that newer\\nantibiotics, like ciprofloxacin and some cephalosporins,\\nmay also prove effective. Although cutaneous anthrax may\\nbe cured following a single dose of antibiotic, it is impor-\\ntant to continue treatment so as to avoid potential serious\\ncomplications, such as inflammation of the membranes\\ncovering the brain and spinal cord (meningitis).\\nPrognosis\\nUntreated anthrax is often fatal, but death is far less\\nlikely with appropriate care. Ten to twenty percent of\\npatients will die from anthrax of the skin (cutaneous\\nanthrax) if it is not properly treated. All patients with\\ninhalation (pulmonary) anthrax will die if untreated.\\nIntestinal anthrax is fatal 25-75% of the time.\\nPrevention\\nAnthrax is relatively rare in the United States\\nbecause of widespread animal vaccination and practices\\nused to disinfect hides or other animal products. For\\nthose in high-risk professions, an anthrax vaccine is\\navailable that is 93% effective in protecting against infec-\\ntion. To provide this immunity, an individual must be\\ngiven an initial course of three injections, given two\\nweeks apart, followed by booster injections at 6, 12, and\\n18 months and an annual immunization thereafter.\\nApproximately 30% of those who have been vacci-\\nnated against anthrax may notice mild local reactions,\\nsuch as a slight tenderness at the injection site. Someone\\nwho has already had anthrax might have a more severe\\nlocal reaction upon vaccination. Infrequently, there may\\nbe a severe local reaction with extensive swelling of the\\nforearm, and only a very few vaccine recipients may\\nhave a more general flu-like reaction to the shot.\\nOther means of preventing the spread of infection\\ninclude carefully handling dead animals suspected of\\nhaving the disease and providing good ventilation when\\nprocessing hides, fur, wool, or hair.

Turkington\\nAntiacne drugs\\nDefinition\\nAntiacne drugs are medicines that help clear up pim-\\nples, blackheads, whiteheads, and more severe forms of\\nacne.\\nPurpose\\nDifferent types of antiacne drugs are used for differ-\\nent purposes. For example, lotions, soaps, gels, and\\ncreams containing benzoyl peroxide or tretinoin may be\\nused to clear up mild to moderately severe acne.\\nIsotretinoin (Accutane) is prescribed only for very\\nsevere, disfiguring acne.\\nAcne is a skin condition that occurs when pores or\\nhair follicles become blocked. This allows a waxy\\nmaterial, sebum, to collect inside the pores or follicles.\\nNormally, sebum flows out onto the skin and hair to\\nform a protective coating, but when it cannot get out,\\nsmall swellings develop on the skin surface. Bacteria\\nand dead skin cells can also collect that can cause\\ninflammation. Swellings that are small and not\\ninflamed are whiteheads or blackheads. When they\\nbecome inflamed, they turn into pimples. Pimples that\\nfill with pus are called pustules.\\nAcne cannot be cured, but acne drugs can help clear\\nthe skin. Benzoyl peroxide and tretinoin work by mildly\\nirritating the skin. This encourages skin cells to slough\\noff, which helps open blocked pores. Benzoyl peroxide\\nalso kills bacteria, which helps prevent whiteheads and\\nblackheads from turning into pimples. Isotretinoin\\nshrinks the glands that produce sebum.\\nDescription\\nBenzoyl peroxide is found in many over-the-counter\\nacne products that are applied to the skin, such as\\nBenoxyl, Clear By Design, Neutrogena Acne, PanOxyl,\\nand some formulations of Clean & Clear, Clearasil, and\\nOxy. Some benzoyl peroxide products are available with-\\nout a physician’s prescription; others require a prescrip-\\ntion. Tretinoin (Retin-A) is available only with a physi-\\ncian’s prescription and comes in liquid, cream, and gel\\nforms, which are applied to the skin. Isotretinoin (Accu-\\ntane), which is taken by mouth in capsule form, is avail-\\nable only with a physician’s prescription. Only physicians\\nwho have experience in diagnosing and treating severe\\nacne, such as dermatologists, should prescribe isotretinoin.\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe recommended dosage depends on the type of\\nanti-acne drug. These drugs usually come with written\\ndirections for patients and should be used only as direct-\\ned. Patients who have questions about how to use the\\nmedicine should check with a physician or pharmacist.\\nPatients who use isotretinoin usually take the medi-\\ncine for a few months, then stop for at least two months.\\nTheir acne may continue to improve even after they stop\\ntaking the medicine. If the condition is still severe after\\nseveral months of treatment and a two-month break, the\\nphysician may prescribe a second course of treatment.\\nPrecautions\\nIsotretinoin\\nIsotretinoin can cause serious birth defects, includ-\\ning mental retardation and physical deformities. This\\nmedicine should not be used during pregnancy. Women\\nwho are able to bear children should not use isotretinoin\\nunless they have very severe acne that has not cleared up\\nwith the use of other anti-acne drugs. In that case, a\\nwoman who uses this drug must have a pregnancy test\\ntwo weeks before beginning treatment and each month\\nthey are taking the drug. Another pregnancy test must be\\ndone one month after treatment ends. The woman must\\nuse an effective birth control method for one month\\nbefore treatment begins and must continue using it\\nthroughout treatment and for one month after treatment\\nends. Women who are able to bear children and who want\\nto use this medicine should discuss this information with\\ntheir health care providers. Before using the medicine,\\nthey will be asked to sign a consent form stating that they\\nunderstand the danger of taking isotretinoin during preg-\\nnancy and that they agree to use effective birth control.\\nDo not donate blood to a blood bank while taking\\nisotretinoin or for 30 days after treatment with the drug\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2226\\nAntiacne drugs\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 226'),\n",

This will help reduce the chance of a pregnant\\nwoman receiving blood containing isotretinoin, which\\ncould cause birth defects.\\nIsotretinoin may cause a sudden decrease in night\\nvision. If this happens, do not drive or do anything else\\nthat could be dangerous until vision returns to normal.\\nLet the physician know about the problem.\\nThis medicine may also make the eyes, nose, and\\nmouth dry. Ask the physician about using special eye\\ndrops to relieve eye dryness. To temporarily relieve the\\ndry mouth, chew sugarless gum, suck on sugarless\\ncandy or ice chips, or use saliva substitutes, which come\\nin liquid and tablet forms and are available without a pre-\\nscription. If the problem continues for more than two\\nweeks, check with a physician or dentist. Mouth dryness\\nthat continues over a long time may contribute to tooth\\ndecay and other dental problems.\\nIsotretinoin may increase sensitivity to sunlight.\\nPatients being treated with this medicine should avoid\\nexposure to the sun and should not use tanning beds, tan-\\nning booths, or sunlamps until they know how the drug\\naffects them.\\nIn the early stages of treatment with isotretinoin,\\nsome people’s acne seems to get worse before it starts\\ngetting better. If the condition becomes much worse or if\\nthe skin is very irritated, check with the physician who\\nprescribed the medicine.\\nBenzoyl peroxide and tretinoin\\nWhen applying antiacne drugs to the skin, be careful\\nnot to get the medicine in the eyes, mouth, or inside of\\nthe nose. Do not put the medicine on skin that is wind\\nburned, sunburned, or irritated, and do not apply it to\\nopen wounds.\\nBecause antiacne drugs such as benzoyl peroxide\\nand tretinoin irritate the skin slightly, avoid doing any-\\nthing that might cause further irritation. Wash the face\\nwith mild soap and water only two or three times a day,\\nunless the physician says to wash it more often. Avoid\\nusing abrasive soaps or cleansers and products that might\\ndry the skin or make it peel, such as medicated cosmet-\\nics, cleansers that contain alcohol, or other acne products\\nthat contain resorcinol, sulfur or salicylic acid.\\nIf benzoyl peroxide or tretinoin make the skin too\\nred or too dry or cause too much peeling, check with a\\nphysician. Using the medicine less often or using a\\nweaker strength may be necessary.\\nTretinoin may increase sensitivity to sunlight. While\\nbeing treated with this medicine, avoid exposure to the sun\\nand do not use tanning beds, tanning booths, or sunlamps.\\nIf it is not possible to avoid being in the sun, use a sun-\\nscreen with a skin protection factor (SPF) of at least 15 or\\nwear protective clothing over the treated areas. The skin\\nmay also become more sensitive to cold and wind. People\\nwho use this medicine should protect their skin from cold\\nand wind until they know how the medicine affects them.\\nBenzoyl peroxide may discolor hair or colored fab-\\nrics.\\nSpecial conditions\\nPeople who have certain medical conditions or who are\\ntaking certain other medicines may have problems if they\\nuse antiacne drugs. Before using these products, be sure to\\nlet the physician know about any of these conditions:\\nALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactions\\nto etretinate, isotretinoin, tretinoin, vitamin A prepara-\\ntions, or benzoyl peroxide in the past should let his or her\\nphysician know before using an antiacne drug. The\\nphysician should also be told about any allergies to\\nfoods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances.\\nPREGNANCY. Women who are pregnant or who may\\nbecome pregnant should check with a physician before\\nusing tretinoin or benzoyl peroxide. Isotretinoin causes\\nbirth defects in humans and must not be used during\\npregnancy.\\nBREASTFEEDING.

By\\nrelaxing the blood vessels, antiangina drugs reduce the\\nheart’s work load and increase the amount of oxygen-\\nrich blood that reaches the heart. These drugs come in\\ndifferent forms, and are used in three main ways:\\n• taken regularly over a long period, they reduce the\\nnumber of angina attacks.\\n• taken just before some activity that usually brings on an\\nattack, such as climbing stairs, they prevent attacks.\\n• taken when an attack begins, they relieve the pain and\\npressure.\\nNot every form of antiangina drug can be used in\\nevery way. Some work too slowly to prevent attacks that\\nare about to begin or to relieve attacks that have already\\nstarted. These forms can be used only to reduce the num-\\nber of attacks. Be sure to understand how and when to\\nuse the type of antiangina drug that has been prescribed.\\nDescription\\nAntiangina drugs, also known as nitrates, come in\\nmany different forms: tablets and capsules that are swal-\\nlowed; tablets that are held under the tongue, inside the\\nlip, or in the cheek until they dissolve; stick-on patches;\\nointment; and in-the-mouth sprays.

The patient experiences marked or persistent\\nfear of one or more social or performance situations in\\nwhich he or she is exposed to unfamiliar people or pos-\\nsible scrutiny by others, and may react in a humiliating\\nor embarrassing way. The exposure to the feared situa-\\ntion produces an anxiety attack. Fear of these episodes\\nof anxiety leads to avoidance behavior, which impairs\\nnormal social functioning, including working or attend-\\ning classes. The patient is aware that these fears are\\nunjustified.\\nDescription\\nIn psychiatric practice, treatment of anxiety has\\nlargely turned from traditional antianxiety agents, anxi-\\nolytics, to antidepressant therapies. In current use, the\\nbenzodiazepines, the best known class of anxiolytics,\\nhave been largely supplanted by serotonin-specific reup-\\ntake inhibitors (SSRIs, citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxam-\\nine and others) which have a milder side effect profile\\nand less risk of dependency. However, traditional anxi-\\nolytics remain useful for patients who need a rapid onset\\nof action, or whose frequency of exposure to anxiety pro-\\nvoking stimuli is low enough to eliminate the need for\\ncontinued treatment. While SSRIs may require three to\\nfive weeks to show any effects, and must be taken contin-\\nuously, benzodiazepines may produce a response within\\n30 minutes, and may be dosed on an as-needed basis.\\nThe intermediate action benzodiazepines, alprazo-\\nlam (Xanax), and lorazepam (Ativan) are the appropriate\\nchoice for treatment of mild anxiety and social phobia.\\nDiazepam (Valium) is still widely used for anxiety, but\\nits active metabolite, desmethyldiazepam, which has a\\nlong half-life, may make this a poorer choice than other\\ndrugs in its class. Note that there is considerable varia-\\ntion between individuals in metabolism of benzodi-\\nazepines, so patient response may not be predictable. As\\na class, benzodiazepines are used not only as anxiolytics,\\nbut also as sedatives,muscle relaxants, and in treatment\\nof epilepsy and alcoholism . The distinctions between\\nthese uses are largely determined by onset and duration\\nof action, and route of administration.\\nBuspirone (BuSpar), which is not chemically related\\nto other classes of central nervous system drugs, is also a\\ntraditional anxiolytic, although it is now considered\\neither a third line or adjunctive agent for use after trials\\nof SSRIs and benzodiazepines.

Their airways become inflamed and\\nblocked with mucus during asthma attacks, narrowing the\\nopening through which air passes. This is not such a prob-\\nlem when the person breathes in, because the airways nat-\\nurally expand when a person takes a breath. The real prob-\\nlem arises when the person with asthma tries to breathe\\nout. The air cannot get out through the blocked airways, so\\nit stays trapped in the lungs. With each new breath, the\\nperson can take in only a little more air, so breathing\\nbecomes shallow and takes more and more effort.\\nAsthma attacks can be caused by allergies to pollen,\\ndust, pets or other things, but people without known\\nallergies may also have asthma. Exercise, stress, intense\\nemotions, exposure to cold, certain medicines and some\\nmedical conditions also can bring on attacks.\\nThe two main approaches to dealing with asthma are\\navoiding substances and situations that trigger attacks\\nand using medicines that treat or prevent the symptoms.\\nWith a combination of the two, most people with asthma\\ncan find relief and live normal lives.\\nDescription\\nThree types of drugs are used in treating and pre-\\nventing asthma attacks:\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2236\\nAntiasthmatic drugs\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 236'),\n",

This makes the airways open wider, letting\\nmore air pass through them. These drugs are used main-\\nly to relieve sudden asthma attacks or to prevent attacks\\nthat might come on after exercise. They may be taken\\nby mouth, injected or inhaled.\\n• Corticosteroids block the inflammation that narrows\\nthe airways. Used regularly, these drugs will help pre-\\nvent asthma attacks. Those attacks that do occur will be\\nless severe. However, corticosteroids cannot stop an\\nattack that is already underway. These drugs may be\\ntaken by mouth, injected or inhaled.\\n• Cromolyn also is taken regularly to prevent asthma\\nattacks and may be used alone or with other asthma\\nmedicines. It cannot stop an attack that already has\\nstarted. The drug works by preventing certain cells in\\nthe body from releasing substances that cause allergic\\nreactions or asthma symptoms. One brand of this\\ndrug, Nasalcrom, comes in capsule and nasal spray\\nforms and is used to treat hay fever and other aller-\\ngies. The inhalation form of the drug, Intal, is used for\\nasthma.

However, with\\nsome kinds of bronchodilators, this can lead to serious\\nand possibly life-threatening complications.

The bacteria Clostridia difficile are normally\\nfound in the intestines of 5% of healthy adults, but peo-\\nple can also pick up the bacteria while they are in a hos-\\npital or nursing home. In a healthy person, harmless resi-\\ndent intestinal bacteria compete with each other for food\\nand places to “sit” along the inner intestinal wall. When\\nantibioticsare given, most of the resident bacteria are\\nKEY TERMS\\nAsthma—A disease in which the air passages of\\nthe lungs become inflamed and narrowed.\\nInflammation —Pain, redness, swelling, and heat\\nthat usually develop in response to injury or ill-\\nness.\\nInhalant —Medicine that is breathed into the\\nlungs.\\nMucus—Thick fluid produced by the moist mem-\\nbranes that line many body cavities and structures.\\nNebulizer —A device that turns liquid forms of\\nmedicine into a fine spray that can be inhaled.\\nkilled. With fewer bacteria to compete with, the normally\\nharmless Clostridia difficile grow rapidly and produce\\ntoxins. These toxins damage the inner wall of the\\nintestines and cause inflammation and diarrhea.\\nAlthough all antibiotics can cause this disease, it is\\nmost commonly caused by clindamycin (Cleocin), ampi-\\ncillin (Omnipen), amoxicillin (Amoxil, Augmentin, or\\nWymox), and any in the cephalosporin class (such as\\ncefazolin or cephalexin). Symptoms of the condition can\\noccur during antibiotic treatment or within four weeks\\nafter the treatment has stopped.\\nIn approximately half of cases of antibiotic-associated\\ncolitis, the condition progresses to a more severe form of\\ncolitis called pseudomembranous enterocolitis in which\\npseudomembranes are excreted in the stools. Pseudomem-\\nbranes are membrane-like collections of white blood cells,\\nmucus, and the protein that causes blood to clot (fibrin)\\nthat are released by the damaged intestinal wall.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAntibiotic-associated colitis is caused by toxins pro-\\nduced by the bacterium Clostridium difficile after treat-\\nment with antibiotics. When most of the other intestinal\\nbacteria have been killed,Clostridium difficile grows\\nrapidly and releases toxins that damage the intestinal\\nwall. The disease and symptoms are caused by these tox-\\nins, not by the bacterium itself.\\nSymptoms of antibiotic-associated colitis usually\\nbegin four to ten days after antibiotic treatment has\\nbegun. The early signs and symptoms of this disease\\ninclude lower abdominal cramps, an increased need to\\npass stool, and watery diarrhea. As the disease progress-\\nes, the patient may experience a general ill feeling,\\nfatigue, abdominal pain, and fever. If the disease pro-\\nceeds to pseudomembranous enterocolitis, the patient\\nmay also experience nausea, vomiting, large amounts of\\nwatery diarrhea, and a very high fever (104-105°F/40-\\n40.5°C). Complications of antibiotic-associated colitis\\ninclude severe dehydration, imbalances in blood miner-\\nals, low blood pressure, fluid accumulation in deep skin\\n(edema), enlargement of the large intestine (toxic mega-\\ncolon), and the formation of a tear (perforation) in the\\nwall of the large intestine.\\nClostridium difficile is easily spread from person to\\nperson in hospitals and nursing homes.

As a result, the elderly are much more prone to\\ndeveloping antibiotic-associated colitis than younger\\nindividuals.\\nDiagnosis\\nAntibiotic-associated colitis can be diagnosed by the\\nsymptoms and recent medical history of the patient, by a\\nlaboratory test for the bacterial toxin, and/or by using a\\nprocedure called endoscopy.\\nIf the diarrhea and related symptoms occurred after\\nthe patient received antibiotics, antibiotic-associated col-\\nitis may be suspected. A stool sample may be analyzed\\nfor the presence of the Clostridium difficile toxin. This\\ntoxin test is the preferred diagnostic test for antibiotic-\\nassociated colitis. One frequently used test for the toxin\\ninvolves adding the processed stool sample to a human\\ncell culture. If the toxin is present in the stool sample, the\\ncells die. It may take up to two days to get the results\\nfrom this test. A simpler test, which provides results in\\ntwo to three hours, is also available. Symptoms and toxin\\ntest results are usually enough to diagnose the disease.\\nAnother tool that may be useful in the diagnosis of\\nantibiotic-associated colitis, however, is a procedure\\ncalled an endoscopy that involves inserting a thin, lighted\\ntube into the rectum to visually inspect the intestinal lin-\\ning. Two different types of endoscopy procedures, the\\nsigmoidoscopyand the colonoscopy , are used to view\\ndifferent parts of the large intestine. These procedures\\nare performed in a hospital or doctor’s office. Patients are\\nsedated during the procedure to make them more com-\\nfortable and are allowed to go home after recovering\\nfrom the sedation.\\nTreatment\\nDiarrhea, regardless of the cause, is always treated\\nby encouraging the individual to replace lost fluids and\\nprevent dehydration. One method to treat antibiotic-asso-\\nciated colitis is to simply stop taking the antibiotic that\\ncaused the disease. This allows the normal intestinal bac-\\nteria to repopulate the intestines and inhibits the over-\\ngrowth of Clostridium difficile. Many patients with mild\\ndisease respond well to this and are free from diarrhea\\nwithin two weeks. It is important, however, to make sure\\nthat the original disease for which the antibiotics were\\nprescribed is treated.\\nKEY TERMS\\nColitis—Inflammation of the colon.\\nEdema—Fluid accumulation in a tissue.\\nEndoscopy—A procedure in which a thin, lighted\\ninstrument is inserted into the interior of a hollow\\norgan, such as the rectum and used to visually\\ninspect the inner intestinal lining.\\nFibrin—A fibrous blood protein vital to coagula-\\ntion and blood clot formation.\\nRectum—The last part of the intestine. Stool pass-\\nes through the rectum and out through the anal\\nopening.\\nToxic megacolon—Acute enlargement or dilation\\nof the large intestine.\\nBecause of the potential seriousness of this disease,\\nmost patients are given another antibiotic to control the\\ngrowth of the Clostridium difficile , usually vancomycin\\n(Vancocin) or metronidazole (Flagyl or Protostat). Both\\nare designed to be taken orally four times a day for 10-14\\ndays. Upon finishing antibiotic treatment, approximately\\n15-20% of patients will experience a relapse of diarrhea\\nwithin one to five weeks. Mild relapses can go untreated\\nwith great success, however, severe relapses of diarrhea\\nrequire another round of antibiotic treatment. Instead of\\nfurther antibiotic treatment, a cholestyramine resin\\n(Questran or Prevalite) may be given. The bacterial tox-\\nins produced in the intestine stick to the resin and are\\npassed out with the resin in the stool. Unfortunately,\\nhowever, vancomycin also sticks to the resin, so these\\ntwo drugs cannot be taken at the same time. Serious dis-\\nease may require hospitalization so that the patient can\\nbe monitored, treated, and rehydrated.\\nAlternative treatment\\nThe goal of alternative treatment for antibiotic-asso-\\nciated enterocolitis is to repopulate the intestinal envi-\\nronment with microorganisms that are normal and\\nhealthy for the intestinal tract. These microorgansisms\\nthen compete for space and keep the Clostridium difficile\\nfrom over-populating.\\nSeveral types of supplements can be used.

Other\\nclasses of drugs, most notably the sulfonamides, may be\\neffective antibacterials. Similarly, some antibiotics may\\nhave secondary uses, such as the use of demeclocycline\\n(Declomycin, a tetracycline derivative) to treat the syn-\\ndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH)\\nsecretion. Other antibiotics may be useful in treating pro-\\ntozoal infections.\\nPurpose\\nAntibiotics are used for treatment or prevention of\\nbacterial infection.\\nDescription\\nClassifications\\nAlthough there are several classification schemes for\\nantibiotics, based on bacterial spectrum (broad versus nar-\\nrow) or route of administration (injectable versus oral ver-\\nsus topical), or type of activity (bactericidal vs. bacteriosta-\\ntic), the most useful is based on chemical structure. Antibi-\\notics within a structural class will generally show similar\\npatterns of effectiveness, toxicity, and allergic potential.\\nPENICILLINS. The penicillins are the oldest class of\\nantibiotics, and have a common chemical structure which\\nthey share with the cephalopsorins. The two groups are\\nclassed as the beta-lactam antibiotics, and are generally\\nbacteriocidal—that is, they kill bacteria rather than\\ninhibiting growth. The penicillins can be further subdi-\\nvided. The natural pencillins are based on the original\\npenicillin G structure; penicillinase-resistant penicillins,\\nnotably methicillin and oxacillin, are active even in the\\npresence of the bacterial enzyme that inactivates most\\nnatural penicillins. Aminopenicillins such as ampicillin\\nand amoxicillin have an extended spectrum of action\\ncompared with the natural penicillins; extended spectrum\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2240\\nAntibiotics\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 240'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 254}, page_content='penicillins are effective against a wider range of bacteria.\\nThese generally include coverage for Pseudomonas\\naeruginaosa and may provide the penicillin in combina-\\ntion with a penicillinase inhibitor.\\nCEPHALOSPORINS. Cephalosporins and the closely\\nrelated cephamycins and carbapenems, like the pen-\\ncillins, contain a beta-lactam chemical structure. Conse-\\nquently, there are patterns of cross-resistance and cross-\\nallergenicity among the drugs in these classes. The\\n“cepha” drugs are among the most diverse classes of\\nantibiotics, and are themselves subgrouped into 1st, 2nd\\nand 3rd generations. Each generation has a broader spec-\\ntrum of activity than the one before. In addition, cefox-\\nitin, a cephamycin, is highly active against anaerobic\\nbacteria, which offers utility in treatment of abdominal\\ninfections. The 3rd generation drugs, cefotaxime, cefti-\\nzoxime, ceftriaxone and others, cross the blood-brain\\nbarrier and may be used to treat meningitis and\\nencephalitis . Cephalopsorins are the usually preferred\\nagents for surgical prophylaxis.\\nFLUROQUINOLONES. The fluroquinolones are syn-\\nthetic antibacterial agents, and not derived from bacteria.\\nThey are included here because they can be readily inter-\\nchanged with traditional antibiotics. An earlier, related\\nclass of antibacterial agents, the quinolones, were not\\nwell absorbed, and could be used only to treat urinary\\ntract infections. The fluroquinolones, which are based on\\nthe older group, are broad-spectrum bacteriocidal drugs\\nthat are chemically unrelated to the penicillins or the\\ncephaloprosins. They are well distributed into bone tis-\\nsue, and so well absorbed that in general they are as\\neffective by the oral route as by intravenous infusion.\\nTETRACYCLINES. Tetracyclines got their name\\nbecause they share a chemical structure that has four\\nrings. They are derived from a species of Streptomyces\\nbacteria. Broad-spectrum bacteriostatic agents, the\\ntetracyclines may be effective against a wide variety\\nof microorganisms, including rickettsia and amebic\\nparasites.\\nMACROLIDES. The macrolide antibiotics are derived\\nfrom Streptomyces bacteria, and got their name because\\nthey all have a macrocyclic lactone chemical structure.\\nErythromycin, the prototype of this class, has a spectrum\\nand use similar to penicillin. Newer members of the\\ngroup, azithromycin and clarithyromycin, are particular-\\nly useful for their high level of lung penetration. Clar-\\nithromycin has been widely used to treat Helicobacter\\npylori infections, the cause of stomach ulcers.\\nOTHERS. Other classes of antibiotics include the\\naminoglycosides, which are particularly useful for their\\neffectiveness in treating Pseudomonas aeruginosa infec-\\ntions; the lincosamindes, clindamycin and lincomycin,\\nwhich are highly active against anaerobic pathogens.\\nThere are other, individual drugs which may have utility\\nin specific infections.\\nRecommended dosage\\nDosage varies with drug, route of administration,\\npathogen, site of infection, and severity. Additional con-\\nsiderations include renal function, age of patient, and\\nother factors. Consult manufacturers’ recommendations\\nfor dose and route.\\nSide effects\\nAll antibiotics cause risk of overgrowth by non-sus-\\nceptible bacteria. Manufacturers list other major hazards\\nby class; however, the health care provider should review\\neach drug individually to assess the degree of risk. Gen-\\nerally, breastfeeding is not recommended while taking\\nantibiotics because of risk of alteration to infant’s intesti-\\nnal flora, and risk of masking infection in the infant.\\nExcessive or inappropriate use may promote growth of\\nresistant pathogens.\\nPenicillins: Hypersensitivity may be common, and\\ncross allergenicity with cephalosporins has been reported.\\nPenicillins are classed as category B during pregnancy.\\nCephalopsorins: Several cephalopsorins and related\\ncompounds have been associated with seizures.

Drug therapy may be\\nused alone, or in combination with other treatments such\\nas surgery or radiation therapy.\\nPurpose\\nAnticancer drugs are used to control the growth of\\ncancerous cells. Cancer is commonly defined as the\\nuncontrolled growth of cells, with loss of differentiation\\nand commonly, with metastasis, spread of the cancer to\\nother tissues and organs. Cancers are malignant growths.\\nIn contrast, benign growths remain encapsulated and grow\\nwithin a well-defined area.

For\\nexample, breast cancers are commonly stimulated by\\nestrogens, and may be treated with drugs which inactive\\nthe sex hormones. Similarly,prostate cancer may be\\ntreated with drugs that inactivate androgens, the male sex\\nhormone. However, the majority of antineoplastic drugs\\nKEY TERMS\\nCataract—Clouding of the lens of the eye, leading\\nto poor vision or blindness.\\nImpotent —Unable to achieve or maintain an\\nerection of the penis.\\nact by interfering with cell growth. Since cancerous cells\\ngrow more rapidly than other cells, the drugs target those\\ncells which are in the process of reproducing themselves.\\nAs a result, antineoplastic drugs will commonly affect\\nnot only the cancerous cells, but others cells that com-\\nmonly reproduce quickly, including hair follicles, ovaries\\nand testis, and the blood-forming organs.\\nNewer approaches to antineoplastic drug therapy\\nhave taken different approaches, including angigenesis—\\nthe inhibition of formation of blood vessels feeding the\\ntumor and contributing to tumor growth. Although these\\napproaches hold promise, they are not yet in common use.\\nAntineoplastic drugs may be divided into two class-\\nes: cycle specific and non-cycle specific. Cycle specific\\ndrugs act only at specific points of the cell’s duplication\\ncycle, such as anaphase or metaphase, while non-cycle\\nspecific drugs may act at any point in the cell cycle. In\\norder to gain maximum effect, antineoplastic drugs are\\ncommonly used in combinations.\\nPrecautions\\nBecause antineoplastic agents do not target specific\\ncell types, they have a number of common adverse side\\neffects. Hair loss is common due to the effects on hair fol-\\nlicles, and anemia, immune system impairment, and clot-\\nting problems are caused by destruction of the blood form-\\ning organs, leading to reduction in the number of red cells,\\nwhite cells, and platelets.

These may include administration of antinause-\\nant medications to reduce nausea and vomiting, main-\\ntaining fluid levels to reduce drug toxicity, particularly to\\nthe kidneys, or application of a scalp tourniquet to reduce\\nblood flow to the scalp and minimize hair loss due to\\ndrug therapy.\\nPatients receiving chemotherapy are also at risk of\\ninfections due to reduced white blood counts. While pro-\\nphylactic antibiotics may be useful, the health care pro-\\nfessional should also be sure to use standard precautions,\\nincluding gowns and gloves when appropriate. Patients\\nshould be alerted to avoid risks of viral contamination,\\nand live virus immunizations are contraindicated until\\nthe patient has fully recovered from the effects of\\nchemotherapy. Similarly, the patient should avoid contact\\nwith other people who have recently had live virus\\nimmunizations.\\nOther precautions which should be emphasized are\\nthe risks to pregnant or nursing women. Because antineo-\\nplastic drugs are commonly harmful to the fetus, women\\nof childbearing potential should be cautioned to use two\\neffective methods of birth control while receiving cancer\\nchemotherapy. This also applies if the woman’s male\\npartner is receiving chemotherapy. Breastfeeding should\\nbe avoided while the mother is being treated.\\nBefore prescribing or administering anticancer\\ndrugs, health care providers should inquire whether the\\npatient has any of the following conditions:\\n• chickenpox or recent exposure to someone with chick-\\nenpox\\n• shingles (Herpes zoster)\\n• mouth sores\\n• current or past seizures\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 247\\nAnticancer drugs\\nAnti Cancer Drugs\\nGeneric (Brand Name) Clinical Uses Common Side Effects To Drug\\nAltretamine (Hexalen) Treatment of advanced ovarian cancer Bone marrow depression, nausea and vomiting\\nAsparaginase (Elspar) Commonly used in combination Liver, kidney, pancreas, CNS abnormalities\\nwith other drugs; refractory acute\\nlymphocytic leukemia\\nBleomycin (Blenoxane) Lymphomas, Hodgkin’s disease, Hair loss, stomatitis, pulmonary toxicity,\\ntesticular cancer hyperpigmentation of skin\\nBusulfan (Myleran) Chronic granulocytic leukemia Bone marrow depression, pulmonary toxicity\\nCarboplatin (Paraplatin) Pallilation of ovarian cancer Bone marrow depression, nausea and vomiting\\nCarmustine Hodgkin’s disease, brain Bone marrow depression, nausea and\\ntumors, multiple myeloma, vomiting, toxic damage to liver\\nmalignant melonoma\\nChlorambucil (Leukeran) Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Bone marrow depression,\\nnon-Hodgkin’s lymphomas, breast excess uric acid in blood\\nand ovarian cancer\\nCisplatin (Platinol) Treatment of bladder, ovarian, uterine, Renal toxicity and ototoxicity\\ntesticular, head and neck cancers\\nCladribine (Leustatin) Hairy cell leukemia Bone marrow depression, nausea and vomiting, fever\\nCyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) Hodgkin’s disease, non-Hodgkin’s Bone marrow depression,\\nlymphomas, neuroblastoma.

Anticoagulant drugs fall into\\nthree categories: inhibitors of clotting factor synthesis,\\ninhibitors of thrombin and antiplatelet drugs.\\nPurpose\\nAnticoagulant drugs reduce the ability of the blood\\nto form clots. Although blood clotting is essential to pre-\\nvent serious bleeding in the case of skin cuts, clots inside\\nthe blood vessels block the flow of blood to major organs\\nand cause heart attacks and strokes. Although these drugs\\nare sometimes called blood thinners, they do not actually\\nthin the blood. Furthermore, this type of medication will\\nnot dissolve clots that already have formed, although the\\ndrug stops an existing clot from worsening. However,\\nanother type of drug, used in thrombolytic therapy, will\\ndissolve existing clots.\\nAnticoagulant drugs are used for a number of condi-\\ntions. For example, they may be given to prevent blood\\nclots from forming after the replacement of a heart valve\\nor to reduce the risk of a stroke or another heart attack\\nafter a first heart attack. They are also used to reduce the\\nchance of blood clots forming during open heart surgery\\nor bypass surgery. Low doses of these drugs may be\\ngiven to prevent blood clots in patients who must stay in\\nbed for a long time after certain types of surgery.\\nBecause anticoagulants affect the blood’s ability to\\nclot, they can increase the risk of severe bleeding and\\nheavy blood loss. It is thus essential to take these drugs\\nexactly as directed and to see a physician regularly as\\nlong as they are prescribed.\\nDescription\\nAnticoagulant drugs, also called anticlotting drugs\\nor blood thinners, are available only with a physician’s\\nprescription. They come in tablet and injectable forms.\\nThey fall into three groups:\\n• Inhibitors of clotting factor synthesis. These anticoagu-\\nlants inhibit the production of certain clotting factors in\\nthe liver. One example is warfarin (brand name:\\ncoumadin).\\n• Inhibitors of thrombin. Thrombin inhibitors interfere\\nwith blood clotting by blocking the activity of throm-\\nbin. They include heparin, lepirudin (Refludan).\\n• Antiplatelet drugs. Antiplatelet drugs interact with\\nplatelets, which is a type of blood cell, to block\\nplatelets from aggregating into harmful clots. They\\ninclude:aspirin, ticlopidine (Ticlid), clopidogrel (Plav-\\nix), tirofiban (Aggrastat), and eptifibatide (Integrilin).\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe recommended dosage depends on the type of\\nanticoagulant drug and the medical condition for which it\\nis prescribed. The prescribing physician or the pharmacist\\nwho filled the prescription can provide information con-\\ncerning the correct dosage. Usually, the physician will\\nadjust the dose after checking the patient’s clotting time.\\nAnticoagulant drugs must be taken exactly as direct-\\ned by the physician. Larger or more frequent doses\\nshould not be taken, and the drug should also not be\\ntaken for longer than prescribed. Taking too much of this\\nmedication can cause severe bleeding. Anticoagulants\\nshould also be taken on schedule. A record of each dose\\nshould be kept as it is taken. If a dose is missed, it should\\nbe taken as soon as possible followed by the regular dose\\nschedule. However, a patient who forgets to take a\\nmissed dose until the next day should not take the missed\\ndose at all and should not double the next dose, as this\\ncould lead to bleeding. A record of all missed doses\\nshould be kept for the prescribing physician who should\\nbe informed at the scheduled visits.\\nPrecautions\\nPersons who take anticoagulants should see a physi-\\ncian regularly while taking these drugs, particularly at\\nthe beginning of therapy. The physician will order peri-\\nodic blood tests to check the blood’s clotting ability. The\\nresults of these tests will help the physician determine\\nthe proper amount of medication to be taken each day.\\nTime is required for normal clotting ability to return\\nafter anticoagulant treatment. During this period, patients\\nmust observe the same precautions they observed while\\ntaking the drug. The length of time needed for the blood\\nto return to normal depends on the type of anticoagulant\\ndrug that was taken. The prescribing physician will advise\\nas to how long the precautions should be observed.\\nPeople who are taking anticoagulant drugs should\\ntell all physicians, dentists, pharmacists, and other med-\\nical professionals who provide medical treatments or ser-\\nvices to them that they are taking such a medication.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2250\\nAnticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 250'),\n",

Vitamin K is found in meats,\\ndairy products, leafy, green vegetables, and some multi-\\nple vitamins and nutritional supplements. For the drugs\\nto work properly, it is best to have the same amount of\\nvitamin K in the body all the time. Foods containing vita-\\nmin K in the diet should not be increased or decreased\\nwithout consulting with the prescribing physician. If the\\npatient takes vitamin supplements, he should check the\\nlabel to see if it contains vitamin K.

Epilepsy is not a single disease—it\\nis a set of symptoms that may have different causes in\\ndifferent people. The common thread is an imbalance in\\nthe brain’s electrical activity. This imbalance causes\\nseizures that may affect part or all of the body and may\\nor may not cause a loss of consciousness. Anticonvulsant\\ndrugs act on the brain to reduce the frequency and severi-\\nty of seizures.\\nSome cases of epilepsy are brought on by head\\ninjuries, brain tumors or infections, or metabolic prob-\\nlems such as low blood sugar. But in some people with\\nepilepsy, the cause is not clear.\\nAnticonvulsant drugs are an important part of the\\ntreatment program for epilepsy. Different kinds of drugs\\nmay be prescribed for different types of seizures. In addi-\\ntion to taking medicine, patients with epilepsy should get\\nenough rest, avoid stress, and practice good health habits.\\nSome physicians believe that giving the drugs to\\nchildren with epilepsy may prevent the condition from\\ngetting worse in later life. However, others say the effects\\nare the same, whether treatment is started early or later in\\nlife. Determining when treatment begins depends on the\\nphysician and his assessment of the patient’s symptoms.\\nPhysicians also prescribe certain anticonvulsant\\ndrugs for other conditions, including bipolar disorder\\nand migraine headaches.\\nDescription\\nAnticonvulsant drugs may be divided into several\\nclasses. The hydantoins include pheytoin (Dilantin) and\\nmephenytoin (Mesantoin.) Ther succimides include etho-\\nsuximide (Zarontin)and methsuccimide (Celontin.) The\\nbenzodiazepines, which are better known for their use as\\ntranquilizers and sedatives, include clonazepam\\n(Klonopin), clorazepate (Tranxene) and diazepam (Vali-\\num.) There are also a large number of other drugs which\\nare not related to larger groups. These include carba-\\nmazepine (Tegretol), valproic acid (Depakote, Depak-\\nene) gabapentin (Neurontin), topiramate (Topamax), fel-\\nbamate (Felbatol) and several others. Phenobarbital has\\nbeen used as an anticonvulsant, and is still useful for\\nsome patients. The drugs are available only with a physi-\\ncian’s prescription and come in tablet, capsule, liquid,\\nand “sprinkle” forms.\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe recommended dosage depends on the type of\\nanticonvulsant, its strength, and the type of seizures for\\nwhich it is being taken. Check with the physician who\\nprescribed the drug or the pharmacist who filled the pre-\\nscription for the correct dosage.\\nDo not stop taking this medicine suddenly after tak-\\ning it for several weeks or more. Gradually tapering the\\ndose may reduce the chance of withdrawal effects.\\nDo not change brands or dosage forms of this medi-\\ncine without checking with a pharmacist or physician. If a\\nprescription refill does not look like the original medicine,\\ncheck with the pharmacist who filled the prescription.\\nPrecautions\\nPatients on anticonvulsant drugs should see a physi-\\ncian regularly while on therapy, especially during the\\nfirst few months. The physician will check to make sure\\nthe medicine is working as it should and will note\\nunwanted side effects. The physician may also need to\\nadjust the dosage during this period.\\nValproic acid can cause serious liver damage, espe-\\ncially in the first 6 months of treatment. Children are par-\\nticularly at risk, but anyone taking this medicine should\\nsee their physician regularly for tests of liver function and\\nshould be alert to symptoms of liver damage, such as yel-\\nlow skin and eyes, facial swelling, loss of appetite, gener-\\nal feeling of illness, loss of appetite, and vomiting. If liver\\nproblems are suspected, call a physician immediately.\\nFelbatol has caused serious liver damage and aplas-\\ntic anemia, a condition in which the bone marrow stops\\nproducing blood cells. Patients taking this drug should\\nhave regular blood counts, and should stop taking the\\ndrug if there are too few red blood cells.\\nWhile taking anticonvulsant drugs, do not start or\\nstop taking any other medicines without checking with a\\nphysician. The other medicines may affect the way the\\nanticonvulsant medicine works.\\nBecause anticonvulsant drugs work on the central\\nnervous system, they may add to the effects of alcohol\\nand other drugs that slow down the central nervous sys-\\ntem, such as antihistamines , cold medicine, allergy\\nmedicine, sleep aids, other medicine for seizures, tran-\\nquilizers, some pain relievers, and muscle relaxants .\\nAnyone taking anticonvulsant drugs should check with\\nhis or her physician before drinking alcohol or taking any\\nmedicines that slow the central nervous system.\\nAnticonvulsant drugs may interact with medicines\\nused during surgery, dental procedures, or emergency\\ntreatment.

The formal diagnosis requires\\na cluster of symptoms, lasting at least two weeks. These\\nsymptoms include, but are not limited to mood changes,\\ninsomniaor hypersomnia, and diminished interest in\\ndaily activities. The symptoms are not caused by any\\nmedical condition, drug side effect, or adverse life event.\\nThe condition is severe enough to cause clinically signif-\\nicant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or\\nother important areas of functioning.\\nSecondary depression, depression caused by unfa-\\nvorable life events, is normally self limiting, and may be\\nbest treated with cognitive/behavioral therapy rather than\\ndrugs.\\nDescription\\nAntidepressant agents act by increasing the levels of\\nexcitatory neurostransmitters. The main types of antide-\\npressant drugs in use today are:\\n• tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline (Elavil),\\nimipramine (Tofranil), nortriptyline (Pamelor)\\n• selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs or\\nserotonin boosters), such as fluoxetine (Prozac), parox-\\netine (Paxil), and sertraline (Zoloft)\\n• monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO inhibitors),\\nsuch as phenelzine (Nardil), and tranylcypromine (Par-\\nnate)\\n• tetracyclic compounds and atypical antidepressants\\nwhich do not fall into any of the above categories\\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors maintain lev-\\nels of the excitatory neurohormone serotonin in the\\nbrain. They do not alter levels of norepinephrine. These\\nhave become the drugs of choice for a variety of psychi-\\natric disorders, primarily because of their low incidence\\nof severe side effects as compared with other drugs in\\nthis therapeutic class. SSRIs show similar actions and\\nside effect profiles, but may vary in duration of action.\\nTricyclic compounds, identified by their chemical\\nstructure containing three carbon rings, are an older class\\nof antidepressants. Although generally effective, they\\nhave a high incidence of anticholinergic effects, notably\\ndry mouthand dry eyes, which can cause discomfort.\\nThey also cause cardiac arrythmias. Because tricyclics\\nact on both serotonin and norepinephrine, they may have\\nsome value in treatment of patients who fail to respond to\\nSSRIs. Drugs in this class are often available at low\\nprices, which may be significant when cost is a major\\nfactor in treatment. They have also been found useful in\\ncontrol of some neurologic pain syndromes.\\nTricyclic antidepressants are similar, but may vary in\\nseverity of side effects, most notably the degree of seda-\\ntion and the extent of the anticholinergic effects.\\nTetracyclic compounds and atypical antidepressants\\nare chemically distinct from both the major groups and\\neach other. Although maprotilene (no brand name, mar-\\nketed in generic form only) and mirtazepine (Remeron)\\nare similar in chemical structures, they differ in their bal-\\nance of activity on serotonine and norepinephrine levels.\\nMonoamine oxidase inhibitors (phenelzine [Nardil],\\ntranylcypromine [Parnate]) have largely been supplanted\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2256\\nAntidepressant drugs\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 256'),\n",

They act by\\ninhibiting the enzyme monoamine oxidase, which is\\nresponsible for the metabolism of the stimulatory neuro-\\nhormones norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine, and\\nserotonin. The MAOIs are normally reserved for patients\\nwho are resistant to safer drugs. Two drugs, eldepryl\\n(Carbex, used in treatment of Parkinson’s disease) and\\nthe herb, St. John’s wort , have some action against\\nmonoamine oxidase B, and have shown some value as\\nanti-depressants. They do not share the same risks as the\\nnon-selective MAO inhibitors.\\nAll antidepressant agents, regardless of their struc-\\nture, have a slow onset of action, typically three to five\\nweeks.

Excitation has been reported in over\\n20% of patients, and insomnia in 33%. Significant weight\\nloss has been frequently reported, but most commonly in\\npatients who are already underweight. SSRIs may cause\\nsome sedation, and patients should be cautioned not to per-\\nform tasks requiring alertness until they have evaluated the\\neffects of these drugs. SSRIs are pregnancy category C\\ndrugs.

Amoxepine (not marketed\\nby brand, generic available), although a tricyclic antide-\\npressant rather than a neuroleptic (major tranquilizer),\\ndisplays some of the more serious effects of the neu-\\nroleptics, including tardive dyskinesias (drug induced\\ninvoluntary movements) and neuroleptic malignant syn-\\ndrome, a potentially fatal syndrome whose symptoms\\ninclude high fever, altered mental status, irregular pulse\\nor blood pressure, and changes in heart rate. These\\nadverse effects have not been reported with other tri-\\ncyclic antidepressants.\\nThe most common adverse effects of tricyclic antide-\\npressants are sedation and the anticholinergic effects,\\nsuch as dry mouth, dry eyes, and difficult urination. Alter-\\nations in heartbeat are also common, and may progress to\\ncongestive heart failure, stroke, and sudden death.\\nTricyclic antidepressants are in pregnancy categories\\nC or D, although there have been no formal studies of the\\ndrugs on fetal development. There are no studies of\\neffects on newborns, but some anecdotal reports of mal-\\nformations have resulted from animal studies.

The greatest risk\\nassociated with these drugs is a hypertensive crisis which\\nmay be fatal and most often occurs when the drugs are\\ntaken with interacting foods or drugs.

Type I is caused\\nby a deficiency of insulin production, while type II is\\ncharacterized by insulin resistance.\\nTreatment of type I diabetes is limited to insulin\\nreplacement, while type II diabetes is treatable by a num-\\nber of therapeutic approaches. Many cases of insulin\\nresistance are asymptomatic due to normal increases in\\ninsulin secretion, and others may be controlled by diet\\nand exercise . Drug therapy may be directed towards\\nincreasing insulin secretion, increasing insulin sensitivi-\\nty, or increasing insulin penetration of the cells.\\nDescription\\nAntidiabetic drugs may be subdivided into six groups:\\ninsulin, sufonylureas, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors,\\nbiguanides, meglitinides, and thiazolidinediones.\\nInsulin (Humulin, Novolin) is the hormone responsi-\\nble for glucose utilization. It is effective in both types of\\ndiabetes, since, even in insulin resistance, some sensitivi-\\nty remains and the condition can be treated with larger\\ndoses of insulin. Most insulins are now produced by\\nrecombinant DNA techniques, and are chemically identi-\\ncal to natural human insulin. Isophane insulin suspen-\\nsion, insulin zinc suspension, and other formulations are\\nintended to extend the duration of action of insulin, and\\npermit glucose control over longer periods of time.\\nSulfonylureas (chlorpropamide [Diabinese], tolaza-\\nmide [Tolinase], glipizide [Glucotrol] and others) act by\\nincreasing insulin release from the beta cells of the pan-\\ncrease. Glimepiride (Amaryl), a member of this class,\\nappears to have a useful secondary action in increasing\\ninsulin sensitivity in peripheral cells.\\nAlpha-glucosidase inhibitors (acarbose [Precose],\\nmiglitol [Glyset]) do not enhance insulin secretion.\\nRather, they inhibit the conversion of disaccharides and\\ncomplex carbohydrates to glucose. This mechanism does\\nnot prevent conversion, but only delays it, reducing the\\npeak blood glucose levels. Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors\\nare useful for either monotherapy or in combination ther-\\napy with sulfonylureas or other hypoglycemic agents.\\nMetformin (Glucophage) is the only available mem-\\nber of the biguanide class. Metformin decreases hepatic\\nglucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of\\nglucose and increases peripheral glucose uptake and uti-\\nlization. Metformin may be used as monotherapy, or in\\ncombination therapy with a sulfonylurea.\\nThere are two members of the meglitinide class:\\nrepaglinide (Prandin) and nateglitinide (Starlix). The\\nmechanism of action of the meglitinides is to stimulate\\ninsulin production. This activity is both dose dependent\\nand dependent on the presence of glucose, so that the\\ndrugs have reduced effectiveness in the presence of low\\nblood glucose levels. The meglitinides may be used alone,\\nor in combination with metformin. The manufacturer\\nwarns that nateglitinide should not be used in combina-\\ntion with other drugs which enhance insulin secretion.\\nRosiglitazone (Avandia) and pioglitazone (Actos)\\nand the members of the thiazolidinedione class. They act\\nby both reducing glucose production in the liver, and\\nincreasing insulin dependent glucose uptake in muscle\\ncells. They do not increase insulin production. These\\ndrugs may be used in combination with metoformin or a\\nsulfonylurea.\\nRecommended dosage\\nDosage must be highly individualized for all antidia-\\nbetic agents and is based on blood glucose levels which\\nmust be taken regularly. Review specific literature.\\nPrecautions\\nInsulin. The greatest short term risk of insulin is\\nhypoglycemia, which may be the result of either a direct\\noverdose or an imbalance between insulin injection and\\nlevel of exercise and diet. This may also occur in the\\npresence of other conditions which reduce the glucose\\nload, such as illness with vomiting and diarrhea. Treat-\\nment is with glucose in the form of glucose tablets or liq-\\nuid, although severe cases may require intravenous thera-\\npy. Allergic reactions and skin reactions may also occur.\\nInsulin is classified as category B in pregnancy , and is\\nconsidered the drug of choice for glucose control during\\npregnancy. Insulin glargine (Lantus), an insulin analog\\nwhich is suitable for once-daily dosing, is classified as\\ncategory C, because there have been reported changes in\\nthe hearts of newborns in animal studies of this drug. The\\nreports are essentially anecdotal, and no cause and effect\\nrelationship has been determined. Insulin is not recom-\\nmended during breast feeding because either low of high\\ndoses of insulin may inhibit milk production. Insulin\\nadministered orally is destroyed in the GI tract, and rep-\\nresents no risk to the newborn.\\nSulonylureas. All sulfonylurea drugs may cause\\nhypoglycemia. Most patients become resistant to these\\ndrugs over time, and may require either dose adjustments\\nor a switch to insulin. The list of adverse reactions is\\nextensive, and includes central nervous system problems\\nand skin reactions, among others. Hematologic reactions,\\nalthough rare, may be severe and include aplastic ane-\\nmia and hemolytic anemia . The administration of oral\\nhypoglycemic drugs has been associated with increased\\ncardiovascular mortality as compared with treatment\\nwith diet alone or diet plus insulin.

Category A: Controlled human\\nstudies have demonstrated no fetal risk. Category\\nB: Animal studies indicate no fetal risk, but no\\nhuman studies; or adverse effects in animals, but\\nnot in well-controlled human studies. Category C:\\nNo adequate human or animal studies; or adverse\\nfetal effects in animal studies, but no available\\nhuman data. Category D: Evidence of fetal risk,\\nbut benefits outweigh risks. Category X: Evidence\\nof fetal risk. Risks outweigh any benefits.\\nSalicylates—A group of drugs that includes aspirin\\nand related compounds. Salicylates are used to\\nrelieve pain, reduce inflammation, and lower fever.\\nSeizure—A sudden attack, spasm, or convulsion.\\nPurpose\\nAntidiarrheal drugs help control diarrhea and some\\nof the symptoms that go along with it. An average,\\nhealthy person has anywhere from three bowel move-\\nments a day to three a week, depending on that person’s\\ndiet. Normally the stool (the material that is passed in a\\nbowel movement) has a texture something like clay. With\\ndiarrhea, bowel movements may be more frequent, and\\nthe texture of the stool is thin and sometimes watery.\\nDiarrhea is not a disease, but a symptom of some other\\nproblem. The symptom may be caused by eating or drink-\\ning food or water that is contaminated with bacteria, virus-\\nes, or parasites, or by eating something that is difficult to\\ndigest. People who have trouble digesting lactose (milk\\nsugar), for example, may get diarrhea if they eat dairy\\nproducts. Some cases of diarrhea are caused by stress,\\nwhile others are brought on by taking certain medicines.\\nDescription\\nAntidiarrheal drugs work in several ways. The drug\\nloperamide, found in Imodium A-D, for example, slows\\nthe passage of stools through the intestines. This allows\\nmore time for water and salts in the stools to be\\nabsorbed back into the body. Adsorbents, such as atta-\\npulgite (found in Kaopectate) pull diarrhea-causing sub-\\nstances from the digestive tract. However, they may also\\npull out substances that the body needs, such as\\nenzymes and nutrients. Bismuth subsalicylate, the ingre-\\ndient in Pepto-Bismol, decreases the secretion of fluid\\ninto the intestine and inhibits the activity of bacteria. It\\nnot only controls diarrhea, but relieves the cramps that\\noften accompany diarrhea.\\nThese medicines come in liquid, tablet, caplet, and\\nchewable tablet forms and can be bought without a\\nphysician’s prescription.\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe dose depends on the type of antidiarrheal drug.\\nRead and follow the directions on the product label. For\\nquestions about dosage, check with a physician or phar-\\nmacist. Never take larger or more frequent doses, and do\\nnot take the drug for longer than directed.\\nPrecautions\\nDiarrhea usually improves within 24-48 hours. If the\\nproblem lasts longer or if it keeps coming back, diarrhea\\ncould be a sign of a more serious problem.

Drugs that decrease ADH levels\\ninclude alcohol, beta-adrenergic agents, morphine antag-\\nonists, and phenytoin (Dilantin).\\nDescription\\nThe purpose of ADH is to control the amount of\\nwater reabsorbed by the kidneys. Water is continually\\nbeing taken into the body in food and drink, as well as\\nbeing produced by chemical reactions in cells. Water is\\nalso continually lost in urine, sweat, feces, and in the\\nbreath as water vapor. ADH release helps maintain the\\noptimum amount of water in the body when there is an\\nincrease in the concentration of the blood serum or a\\ndecrease in blood volume. Physical stress, surgery, and\\nhigh levels of anxiety can also stimulate ADH.\\nVarious factors can affect ADH production, thereby\\ndisturbing the body’s water balance. For example, alcohol\\nconsumption reduces ADH production by direct action on\\nthe brain, resulting in a temporarily increased production\\nof urine. This may also occur in diabetes insipidus, when\\nthe pituitary gland produces insufficient ADH, or rarely,\\nwhen the kidneys fail to respond to ADH. The reverse\\neffect of water retention can result from temporarily\\nincreased ADH production after a major operation or\\naccident. Water retention may also be caused by the\\nsecretion of ADH by some tumors, especially of the lung.\\nPreparation\\nThe test requires collection of a blood sample.

A fungus is an organism that can be either one-\\ncelled or filamentous. Unlike a plant, which makes its\\nown food, or an animal, which eats plants or other ani-\\nmals, a fungus survives by invading and living off other\\nliving things. Fungi thrive in moist, dark places, includ-\\ning some parts of the body.\\nFungal infections can either be systemic, meaning\\nthat the infection is deep, or topical (dermatophytic),\\nmeaning that the infection is superficial and occurs on the\\nskin. Additionally, yeast infections can affect the mucous\\nmembranes of the body. Fungal infections on the skin are\\nusually treated with creams or ointments (topical antifun-\\ngal drugs). However, systemic infections, yeast infections\\nor topical infections that do not clear up after treatment\\nwith creams or ointments may need to be treated with sys-\\ntemic antifungal drugs. These drugs are used, for example,\\nto treat common fungal infections such as tinea (ring-\\nworm), which occurs on the skin or candidiasis (a yeast\\ninfection, also known as trush), which can occur in the\\nthroat, in the vagina, or in other parts of the body. They are\\nalso used to treat other deep fungal infections such as\\nhistoplasmosis, blastomycosis, and aspergillosis, which\\ncan affect the lungs and other organs. They are sometimes\\nused to prevent or treat fungal infections in people whose\\nimmune systems are weakened, such as bone marrow or\\norgan transplant patients and people with AIDS.\\nDescription\\nAntifungal drugs are categorized depending on their\\nroute or site of action, their mechanism of action and\\ntheir chemical nature.\\nSystemic antifungal drugs, such as capsofungin (Can-\\ncidas), flucytosine, fluconazole (Diflucan), itraconazole\\n(Sporanox), ketoconazole (Nizoral), and miconazole\\n(Monistat I.V .) are available only by prescription.

In this condition,\\nfood and stomach juices flow backward from the stom-\\nach into the esophagus, the part of the digestive tract\\nthrough which food passes on its way from the mouth to\\nthe stomach. Normally, a muscular ring called the lower\\nesophageal sphincter (LES) opens to allow food into the\\nstomach and then closes to prevent the stomach’s con-\\ntents from flowing back into the esophagus. In people\\nwith GERD, this muscular ring is either weak or it relax-\\nes at the wrong times. The main symptom is heartburn—\\na burning sensation centered behind the breastbone and\\nspreading upward toward the neck and throat.\\nCisapride works by strengthening the lower\\nesophageal sphincter and making the stomach empty\\nmore quickly.

Most of these organ-\\nisms cause infections by being ingested in the form of\\neggs or larvae, usually present on contaminated food or\\nclothing, while others gain entry through skin abrasions.\\nCommon parasitic infestations include amebiasis, malar-\\nia, giardiasis, hookworm, pinworm, threadworm, whip-\\nworm and tapeworm infestations. Once in the body, para-\\nsitic worms may go unnoticed if they cause no severe\\nsymptoms. However, if they multiply rapidly and spread to\\na major organ, they can cause very serious and even life-\\nthreatening conditions. Antihelminthic drugs are pre-\\nscribed to treat these infestations. They function either by\\ndestroying the worms on contact or by paralyzing them, or\\nby altering the permeability of their plasma membranes.\\nThe dead worms then pass out of the body in the feces.\\nDescription\\nAntihelminthic drugs are available only with a pre-\\nscription and are available as liquids, tablets or capsules.\\nSome commonly used antihelminthics include: albenda-\\nzole (Albenza), mebendazole (Vermox), niclosamide\\n(Niclocide), oxamniquine (Vansil), praziquantel (Biltri-\\ncide), pyrantel (Antiminth), pyantel pamoate (Antiminth)\\nand thiabendazole (Mintezol). Some types of parasitic\\ninfestations are rarely seen in the United States, thus, the\\ncorresponding antihelminthic drugs are not widely dis-\\ntributed and need to be obtained from the United States\\nCenter for Disease Control (CDC) when required. These\\ninclude for example bitional and ivermectin, used to treat\\nonchocerciasis infestations. Other antihelminthic drugs,\\nsuch as diethylcarbamazepine citrate (Hetrezan), used\\nfor treatment of roundworms and other parasites, is sup-\\nplied directly by its manufacturer when needed.\\nMost antihelminthic drugs are only active against spe-\\ncific parasites, some are also toxic. Before treatment, the\\nparasites must therefore be identified using tests that look\\nfor parasites, eggs or larvae in feces, urine, blood, sputum,\\nor tissues. Thus, niclosamide is used against tapeworms,\\nbut will not be effective for the treatment of pinworm or\\nroundworm infestations, because it acts by inhibiting ATP\\nproduction in tapeworm cells.

They may form for various reasons. Frequent heavy\\nlifting, sitting for long periods, or straining to have bowel\\nmovements may put stress on anal tissues, which can lead\\nto hemorrhoids. Some women develop hemorrhoids dur-\\ning pregnancy as the expanding uterus puts pressure on\\nthe anal tissues.

They have no\\neffect on rate of histamine release, nor do they inactivate\\nhistamine. By inhibiting the activity of histamine, they\\ncan reduce capillary fragility, which produces the erythe-\\nma, or redness, associated with allergic reactions. They\\nwill also reduce histamine-induced secretions, including\\nexcessive tears and salivation. Additional effects vary\\nwith the individual drug used. Several of the older drugs,\\ncalled first-generation antihistamines, bind non-selec-\\ntively to H1 receptors in the central nervous system as\\nwell as to peripheral receptors, and can produce sedation,\\ninhibition of nausea and vomiting, and reduction of\\nmotion sickness. The second-generation antihistamines\\nbind only to peripheral H 1 receptors, and reduce allergic\\nresponse with little or no sedation.\\nThe first-generation antihistamines may be divided\\ninto several chemical classes. The side effect profile,\\nwhich also determines the uses of the drugs, will vary by\\nchemical class. The alkylamines include brompheni-\\nramine (Dimetapp) and chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trime-\\nton.) These agents cause relatively little sedation, and are\\nused primarily for treatment of allergic reactions. Promet-\\nhazine (Phenergan), in contrast, is a phenothiazine, chem-\\nically related to the major tranquilizers, and while it is\\nused for treatment of allergies, may also be used as a\\nsedative, the relieve anxiety prior to surgery, as an anti-\\nnauseant, and for control of motion sickness.

He then joined the Pasteur Insti-\\ntute in Paris, becoming director of the Laboratory of\\nTherapeutic Chemistry in 1936.\\nBovet investigated histamine, thought to cause aller-\\ngy symptoms. No antagonist of histamine was known, so\\nBovet—with his research student Anne-Marie Staub—\\nbegan studying substances that blocked hormones simi-\\nlar to histamine. By 1937 he had produced the first anti-\\nhistamine, thymoxydiethylamine.

Within this therapeutic class, there are several\\nsubgroups. There are a very large number of drugs used to\\ncontrol hypertension, and the drugs listed below are rep-\\nresentatives, but not the only members of their classes.\\nThe calcium channel blocking agents, also called\\nslow channel blockers or calcium antagonists, inhibit the\\nmovement of ionic calcium across the cell membrane.\\nThis reduces the force of contraction of muscles of the\\nheart and arteries. Although the calcium channel block-\\ners are treated as a group, there are four different chemi-\\ncal classes, leading to significant variations in the activi-\\nty of individual drugs. Nifedipine (Adalat, Procardia) has\\nthe greatest effect on the blood vessels, while verapamil\\n(Calan, Isoptin) and diltiazem (Cardizem) have a greater\\neffect on the heart muscle itself.\\nPeripheral vasodilators such as hydralazine\\n(Apresoline), isoxuprine (Vasodilan), and minoxidil\\n(Loniten) act by relaxing blood vessels.\\nThere are several groups of drugs which act by reduc-\\ning adrenergic nerve stimulation, the excitatory nerve\\nstimulation that causes contraction of the muscles in the\\narteries, veins, and heart. These drugs include the beta-\\nadrenergic blockers and alpha/beta adrenergic blockers.\\nThere are also non-specific adrenergic blocking agents.\\nBeta-adrenergic blocking agents include propranolol\\n(Inderal), atenolol (Tenormin), and pindolol (Visken).\\nPropranolol acts on the beta-adrenergic receptors any-\\nwhere in the body, and has been used as a treatment for\\nemotional anxiety and rapid heart beat. Atenolol and\\nacebutolol (Sectral) act specifically on the nerves of the\\nheart and circulation.\\nThere are two alpha/beta adrenergic blockers,\\nlabetolol (Normodyne, Trandate) and carvedilol (Coreg).\\nThese work similarly to the beta blockers.\\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE\\ninhibitors) act by inhibiting the production of angiotensin\\nII, a substance that both induces constriction of blood\\nvessels and retention of sodium, which leads to water\\nretention and increased blood volume. There are 10 ACE\\ninhibitors currently marketed in the United States,\\nincluding captopril (Capoten), benazepril (Lotensin),\\nenalapril (Vasotec), and quinapril (Acupril). The primary\\ndifference between these drugs is their onset and dura-\\ntion of action.\\nThe ACE II inhibitors, losartan (Cozaar), candesar-\\ntan (Atacand), irbesartan (Avapro), telmisartan\\n(Micardis), valsartan (Diovan) and eprosartan (Teveten)\\ndirectly inhibit the effects of ACE II rather than blocking\\nits production. Their actions are similar to the ACE\\ninhibitors, but they appear to have a more favorable side\\neffect and safety profile.\\nIn addition to these drugs, other classes of drugs\\nhave been used to lower blood pressure, most notably the\\nthiazide diuretics . There are 12 thiazide diuretics mar-\\nketed in the United States, including hydrochlorothiazide\\n(Hydrodiuril, Esidrex), indapamide (Lozol), polythiazide\\n(Renese), and hydroflumethiazide (Diucardin). The\\ndrugs in this class appear to lower blood pressure\\nthrough several mechanisms. By promoting sodium loss\\nthey lower blood volume. At the same time, the pressure\\nof the walls of blood vessels, the peripheral vascular\\nresistance, is lowered. Thiazide diuretics are commonly\\nused as the first choice for reduction of mild hyperten-\\nsion, and may be used in combination with other antihy-\\npertensive drugs.\\nRecommended dosage\\nRecommended dosage varies with patient, drug,\\nseverity of hypertension, and whether the drug is being\\nused alone or in combination with other drugs. Consult\\nspecialized references for further information.\\nPrecautions\\nBecause of the large number of classes and individ-\\nual drugs in this group, consult specialized references for\\ncomplete information.\\nPeripheral vasodilators may cause dizziness and\\northostatic hypotension—a rapid lowering of blood pres-\\nsure when the patient stands up in the morning.

Commonly gout occurs\\nin males in their 40s and 50s. Gout is defined by the\\nattacks of (arthritic) painful, reddened joints, and is often\\naccompanied by hard lumps in the painful joints. The\\nmost common joint affected is the big toe. Kidney\\nstones, and/or poor kidney function may also be associ-\\nated with hyperuricemia, but may not be considered gout\\nif the patient does not have painful joints. In persons with\\ngout (and associated symptoms), uric acid forms crystals,\\nwhich then cause the aforementioned symptoms.\\nAlthough uric acid levels must be high in order for\\npatients to have crystals form, and therefore have gout,\\nmost persons with high uric acid levels don’t ever have\\nsymptoms.

Thus,\\ndrugs that lower uric acid levels and are used to treat gout\\nin the long term are not used in the short term. Medica-\\ntions used in acute gout attacks include non-steroidal anti-\\ninflammatory drugs (such as indomethacin), colchicine,\\nand corticosteroids .

Physicians also prescribe medi-\\ncines in the benzodiazepine family, such as flurazepam\\n(Dalmane), quazepam (Doral), triazolam (Halcion), esta-\\nzolam (ProSom), and temazepam (Restoril), for insom-\\nnia. Benzodiazepine drugs are described in the essay on\\nantianxiety drugs . Zaleplon (Sonata) is another anti-\\ninsomnia drug that is not related to other drugs with the\\nsame effect. The barbiturates , such as pentobarbital\\n(Nembutal) and secobarbital (Seconal) are no longer\\ncommonly used to treat insomnia because they are too\\ndangerous if they are taken in overdoses. For patients\\nwith mild insomnia, some antihistamines , such as\\ndiphenhydramine (Benadryl) or hydroxyzine (Atarax)\\nmay be used, since these also cause sleepiness.\\nZolpidem is available only with a physician’s pre-\\nscription and comes in tablet form.\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe recommended dose for adults is 5-10 mg just\\nbefore bedtime. The medicine works quickly, often within\\n20 minutes, so it should be taken right before going to bed.\\nFor older people and others who may be more sensi-\\ntive to the drug’s effects, the recommended starting\\ndosage is 5 mg just before bedtime.\\nNever take more than 10 mg of zolpidem in one 24-\\nhour period. Overdoses can lead to excessive sleepiness\\nor coma.\\nZolpidem may be taken with food or on an empty\\nstomach, but it may work faster when taken on an empty\\nstomach. Check with a physician or pharmacists for\\ninstructions on how to take the medicine.\\nPrecautions\\nZolpidem is meant only for short-term treatment of\\ninsomnia. If sleep problems last more than seven to 10\\ndays, check with a physician. Longer-lasting sleep prob-\\nlems could be a sign of another medical problem. Also,\\nthis drug may lose its effectiveness when taken every\\nnight for more than a few weeks.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2282\\nAnti-insomnia drugs\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 282'),\n",

The disease is caused by a parasite,\\nPlasmodium, which belongs to a group of one-celled\\norganisms known as protozoa. The only way to get\\nmalaria is to be bitten by a certain type of mosquito that\\nhas bitten someone who has the disease.Thanks to mos-\\nquito control programs, malaria has been eliminated in\\nthe United States, almost all of Europe, and large parts of\\nCentral and South America. However, mosquito control\\nhas not worked well in other parts of the world, and\\nmalaria continues to be a major health problem in parts\\nof Africa, Southeast Asia, Latin America, Haiti, the\\nDominican Republic, and some Pacific Islands. Every\\nyear, some 30,000 Americans and Europeans who travel\\nto these areas get malaria. People planning to travel to\\nthe tropics are often advised to take antimalarial drugs\\nbefore, during, and after their trips, to help them avoid\\ngetting the disease and bringing it home with them.\\nThese drugs kill Plasmodium or prevent its growth.\\nIn recent years, some strains of Plasmodium have\\nbecome resistant to antimalarial drugs, and medical\\nresearchers have stepped up efforts to develop a malaria\\nvaccine. In early1997, researchers reported encouraging\\nresults from a small study of one vaccine and planned to\\ntest the vaccine in Africa.\\nDescription\\nAntimalarial drugs are available only with a physi-\\ncian’s prescription. They come in tablet, capsule, and\\ninjectable forms. Among the commonly used antimalari-\\nal drugs are chloroquine (Aralen), mefloquine (Lariam),\\nprimaquine, pyrimethamine (Daraprim), and quinine.\\nRecommended dosage\\nRecommended dosage depends on the type of anti-\\nmalarial drug, its strength, and the form in which it is\\nbeing used (such as tablet or injection). The dosage may\\nalso be different for different people. Check with the\\nphysician who prescribed the drug or the pharmacist who\\nfilled the prescription for the correct dosage. Always take\\nthis medicine exactly as directed, and keep taking it for\\nthe full time of treatment. If the drug is being taken to\\ntreat malaria, do not stop taking it just because symptoms\\nbegin to improve. Symptoms may return if the drug is\\nstopped too soon. Never take larger or more frequent\\ndoses than the physician has ordered, and do not take the\\ndrug for longer than directed.\\nTravelers taking this medicine to prevent malaria may\\nbe told to take it for one to two weeks before their trip and\\nfor 4 weeks afterward, as well as for the whole time they\\nare away. It is important to follow these directions.\\nAntimalarial drugs work best when they are taken on\\na regular schedule. When taken once a week to prevent\\nmalaria, they should be taken on the same day every\\nweek. When taken daily or several times a day to treat\\nmalaria, they should be taken at the same time every day.\\nDoses should not be missed or skipped.\\nSome antimalarial drugs should be taken with meals\\nor with milk to prevent upset stomach. Others must be\\ntaken with a full glass of water. Be sure to follow direc-\\ntions for the best way to take the drug that is prescribed.\\nPrecautions\\nAntimalarial drugs may cause lightheadedness,\\ndizziness, blurred vision and other vision changes. Any-\\none who takes these drugs should not drive, use machines\\nor do anything else thatmight be dangerous until they\\nhave found out how the drugs affect them.\\nThe antimalarial drug mefloquine (Lariam) has\\nreceived attention because of reports that it causes panic\\nattacks,hallucinations , anxiety, depression, paranoia,\\nand other mental and mood changes, sometimes lasting\\nfor months after the last dose. A study published in 1996\\nin the British Medical Journalnoted that about one in 140\\ntravelers who take the drug may have mental or mood\\nchanges severe enough to interfere with normal activities.\\nThis compares to about one in 1,100 patients who have\\nsuch reactions to the antimalarial drug chloroquine. Any-\\none who has unexplained anxiety, depression, restless-\\nness, confusion, or other troubling mental or mood\\nchanges after taking mefloquine should call a physician\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2286\\nAntimalarial drugs\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 286'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 302}, page_content='Purpose\\nMigraine headaches usually cause a throbbing pain\\non one side of the head. Nausea, vomiting, dizziness ,\\nincreased sensitivity to light and sound, and other symp-\\ntoms may accompany the pain. The attacks may last for\\nseveral hours or for a day or more and may come as often\\nas several times a week. Some people who get migraine\\nheadaches have warning signals before the headaches\\nbegin, such as restlessness, tingling in an arm or leg, or\\nseeing patterns of flashing lights. This set of signals is\\ncalled an aura. The antimigraine drugs discussed in this\\nsection are meant to be taken as soon as the pain begins,\\nto relieve the pain and other symptoms. Other types of\\ndrugs, such as antiseizure medicines, antidepressants,\\ncalcium channel blockersand beta blockers, are some-\\ntimes prescribed to prevent attacks in people with very\\nsevere or frequent migraines.\\nDescription\\nMigraine is thought to be caused by electrical and\\nchemical imbalances in certain parts of the brain. These\\nimbalances affect the blood vessels in the brain—first\\ntightening them up, then widening them. As the blood ves-\\nsels widen, they stimulate the release of chemicals that\\nincrease sensitivity to pain and cause inflammation and\\nswelling. Antimigraine drugs are believed to work by cor-\\nrecting the imbalances and by tightening the blood vessels.\\nExamples of drugs in this group are ergotamine\\n(Cafergot), naratriptan (Amerge), sumatriptan (Imitrex),\\nrizatriptan (Maxalt) and zolmitriptan (Zomig). Methy-\\nsergide maleate (Sansert) may be used by patients whose\\nheadaches are not controlled by other drugs, while some\\npatients do well on other drugs. For example, combina-\\ntions or ergotamine and caffeine may be very effective.\\nThe caffeine acts by constricting blood vessels to relieve\\nthe headache . Sometimes, an analgesic such as aceta-\\nminophen , caffeine, and a barbiturate which acts as a\\nsedative, are combined, as in Fioricet and similar com-\\npounds. These medicines are available only with a physi-\\ncian’s prescription and come in several forms. Ergota-\\nmine is available as tablets and rectal suppositories;\\nsumatriptan as tablets, injections, and nasal spray; and\\nzolmitriptan as tablets.\\nAntimigraine drugs are used to treat headaches once\\nthey have started. These drugs should not be taken to pre-\\nvent headaches.\\nRecommended dosage\\nRecommended dosage depends on the type of drug.\\nTypical recommended dosages for adults are given below\\nfor each type of drug.\\nErgotamine\\nTake at the first sign of a migraine attack. Patients\\nwho get warning signals (aura) may take the drug as soon\\nas they know a headache is coming.\\nTABLETS. No more than six tablets for any single\\nattack.\\nNo more than 10 tablets per week.\\nSUPPOSITORIES. No more than two suppositories\\nfor any single attack.\\nNo more than five suppositories per week.\\nNaratriptan\\nTake as soon as pain or other migraine symptoms\\nbegin. Also effective if taken any time during an attack.\\nDo not take the drug until the pain actually starts as not\\nall auras result in a migraine.\\nTABLETS. Usual dose is one 1-mg tablet taken with\\nwater or other liquid.\\nDoses of 2.5-mg may be used, but they may cause\\nmore side effects.\\nIf the headache returns or if there is only partial\\nresponse, the dose may be repeated once after four hours,\\nfor a maximum dose of 5 mg in a 24-hour period. Larger\\ndoses do not seem to offer any benefit.\\nSumatriptan\\nTake as soon as pain or other migraine symptoms\\nbegin.

Autoantibodies are proteins built by the\\nbody, but instead of guarding against foreign material\\n(including bacteria, viruses, and fungi) as normal anti-\\nbodies do, they attack the body’s own cells.\\nAutoimmune and rheumatic diseases can be difficult\\nto diagnose. People with the same disease can have very\\ndifferent symptoms. A helpful strategy in the diagnosis\\nof these diseases is to find and identify an autoantibody\\nin the person’s blood.\\nThe antinuclear antibody test looks for a group of\\nautoantibodies that attack substances found in the center\\n(nucleus) of all cells. It is useful as a screen for many\\nautoantibodies associated with diseases that affect the\\nentire body (systemic diseases).\\nThis test is particularly useful when diagnosing a\\nperson with symptoms of SLE, an illness that affects\\nmany body organs and tissues. If the test is negative, it is\\nunlikely that the person has SLE; if the test is positive,\\nmore tests are done to confirm whether the person has\\nSLE or another related disease. Other diseases, such as\\nscleroderma, Sjögren’s syndrome, Raynaud’s disease,\\nrheumatoid arthritis , and autoimmune hepatitis, often\\nhave a positive test for antinuclear antibodies.\\nDescription\\nFive to 10 mL of blood is needed for this test. The\\nantinuclear antibody test is done by adding a person’s\\nserum to commercial cells mounted on a microscope\\nslide. If antinuclear antibodies are in the serum, they bind\\nto the nuclei of cells on the slide. Next, a second anti-\\nbody is added to the mixture. This antibody is “tagged”\\nwith a fluorescent dye so that it can be seen. The second\\nantibody attaches to any antibodies and cells bound\\ntogether and, because of the fluorescent “tag,” the areas\\nwith antinuclear antibodies seem to glow, or fluoresce,\\nwhen the slide is viewed under an ultraviolet microscope.\\nIf fluorescent cells are seen, the test is positive.\\nWhen positive, the serum is diluted, or titered, and the\\ntest done again. These steps are repeated until the serum\\nis so dilute it no longer gives a positive result. The last\\ndilution that shows fluorescence is the titer reported.\\nThe pattern of fluorescence within the cells gives the\\nphysician clues as to what the disease might be.

Parkinson’s disease is the most\\ncommon form of parkinsonism and is seen more fre-\\nquently with advancing age. Other forms of the disorder\\nmay result from viral infections, environmental toxins,\\ncarbon monoxide poisoning, and the effects of treat-\\nment with antipsychotic drugs.\\nThe immediate cause of Parkinson’s disease or\\nParkinsonian-like syndrome is the lack of the neurotrans-\\nmitter dopamine in the brain. Drug therapy may take sev-\\neral forms, including replacement of dopamine, inhibition\\nof dopamine metabolism to increase the effects of the\\ndopamine already present, or sensitization of dopamine\\nreceptors. Drugs may be used singly or in combination.\\nDescription\\nLevodopa (Larodopa) is the mainstay of Parkinson’s\\ntreatment. The drug crosses the blood-brain barrier, and is\\nconverted to dopamine. The drug may be administered\\nalone, or in combination with carbidopa (Lodosyn) which\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 295\\nAntiparkinson drugs\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 295'),\n",

The limitation of levodopa or levodopa-carbidopa\\ntherapy is that after approximately two years of treatment,\\nthe drugs cease to work reliably. This has been termed the\\n“on-off phenomenon.” Additional treatment strategies\\nhave been developed to retard the progression of Parkin-\\nsonism, or to find alternative approaches to treatment.\\nAnticholinergic drugs reduce some of the symptoms\\nof Parkinsonism, and reduce the reuptake of dopamine,\\nthereby sustaining the activity of the natural neurohor-\\nmone. They may be effective in all stages of the disease.\\nAll drugs with anticholinergic properties, the naturally\\noccurring belladonna alkaloids (atropine, scopolamine,\\nhyoscyamine), some antihistamines with anticholinergic\\nproperties, and synthetics such as benztropin (Cogentin),\\nprocyclidine (Kemadrin) and biperiden (Akineton) are\\nmembers of this group. Although the anticholinergic\\ndrugs have only limited activity against Parkinson’s dis-\\nease, they are useful in the early stages, and may be\\nadjuncts to levodopa as the disease progresses.\\nAmantadine (Symmetrel), was developed for pre-\\nvention of influenza virus infection, but has anti-Parkin-\\nsonian properties. Its mechanism of action is not known.\\nBromocriptine (Parlodel) is a prolactin inhibitor,\\nwhich is used for a variety of indications including\\namenorrhea/galactorrhea, female infertility , and\\nacromegaly. It appears to work by direct stimulation of\\nthe dopamine receptors. Bromocriptine is used as a late\\nadjunct to levodopa therapy, and may permit reduction in\\nlevodopa dosage. Pergolide (Permax) is similar to\\nbromocriptine, but has not been studied as extensively in\\nParkinson’s disease.\\nEntacapone (Comtan) appears to act by maintaining\\nlevels of dopamine through enzyme inhibition. It is used\\nas an adjunct to levodopa was the patient is beginning to\\nexperience the on-off effect. Tolcapone (Tasmar) is a\\nsimilar agent, but has demonstrated the potential for\\ninducing severe liver failure. As such, tolcapone is\\nreserved for cases where all other adjunctive therapies\\nhave failed or are contraindicated.\\nSelegeline (Carbex, Eldepryl) is a selective\\nmonoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor, however its\\nmechanism of action in Parkinsonism is unclear, since\\nother drugs with MAO-B inhibition have failed to show\\nsimilar anti-Parkinsonian effects. Selegeline is used pri-\\nmarily as an adjunct to levodopa, although some studies\\nhave indicated that the drug may be useful in the early\\nstages of Parkinsonism, and may delay the progression\\nof the disease.\\nPramipexole (Mirapex) and ropinirole (Requip) are\\nbelieved to act by direct stimulation of the dopamine recep-\\ntors in the brain. They may be used alone in early Parkison’s\\ndisease, or as adjuncts to levodopa in advanced stages.\\nRecommended dosage\\nDosages of anti-Parkinsonian medications must be\\nhighly individualized. All doses must be carefully titrat-\\ned. Consult specific references.\\nPrecautions\\nThere are a large number of drugs and drug classes\\nused to treat Parkinson’s disease, and individual refer-\\nences should be consulted.\\nThe anticholinergics have a large number of adverse\\neffects, all related to their primary mode of activity.

Anti-psychotic drugs control\\nthe symptoms of psychosis, and in many cases are effec-\\ntive in controlling the symptoms of other disorders that\\nmay lead to psychosis, including bipolar mood disorder\\n(formerly termed manic-depressive), in which the patient\\ncycles from severe depression to feelings of extreme\\nexcitation. This class of drugs is primarily composed of\\nthe major tranquilizers; however, lithium carbonate, a\\ndrug that is largely specific to bipolar mood disorder, is\\ncommonly classified among the antipsychotic agents.\\nDescription\\nThe antipsychotic agents may be divided by chemi-\\ncal class. The phenothiazines are the oldest group, and\\ninclude chlorpromazine (Thorazine), mesoridazine (Ser-\\nentil), prochlorperazine (Compazine), and thioridazine\\n(Mellaril). These drugs are essentially similar in action\\nand adverse effects. They may also be used as anti-emet-\\nics, although prochlorperazine is the drug most often\\nused for this indication.\\nThe phenylbutylpiperadines are haloperidol (Haldol)\\nand pimozide (Orap). They find primary use in control of\\nTourette’s syndrome. Haloperidol has been extremely\\nuseful in controlling aggressive behavior.\\nThe debenzapine derivatives, clozapine (Clozaril),\\nloxapine (Loxitane), olanzapine (Zyprexa) and quetiap-\\nine (Seroquel), have been effective in controlling psy-\\nchotic symptoms that have not been responsive to other\\nclasses of drugs.\\nThe benzisoxidil group is composed of resperidone\\n(Resperidal) and ziprasidone (Geodon). Resperidone has\\nbeen found useful for controlling bipolar mood disorder,\\nwhile ziprasidone is used primarily as second-line treat-\\nment for schizophrenia.\\nIn addition to these drugs, the class of antipsychotic\\nagents includes lithium carbonate (Eskalith, Lithonate),\\nwhich is used for control of bipolar mood disorder, and\\nthiothixene (Navane), which is used in the treatment of\\npsychosis.\\nRecommended dosage\\nDose varies with the drug, condition being treated,\\nand patient response. See specific references.\\nPrecautions\\nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). NMS is a\\nrare, idiosyncratic combination of extra-pyramidal symp-\\ntoms (EPS), hyperthermia, and autonomic disturbance.\\nOnset may be hours to months after drug initiation, but\\nonce started, proceeds rapidly over 24 to 72 hours. It is\\nmost commonly associated with haloperidol, long-acting\\nfluphenazine, but has occurred with thiothixene, thiori-\\ndazine, and clozapine, and may occur with other agents.\\nNMS is potentially fatal, and requires intensive sympto-\\nmatic treatment and immediate discontinuation of neu-\\nroleptic treatment. There is no established treatment.\\nMost patients who develop NMS will have the same\\nproblem if the drug is restarted.\\nTardive dyskinesia (TD). Tardive dyskinesia is a\\nsyndrome of involuntary movements that may appear in\\npatients treated with neuroleptic drugs. Although preva-\\nlence of TD appears highest among the elderly, especial-\\nly women, it is impossible to predict which patients are\\nlikely to develop the syndrome. Both the risk of develop-\\ning TD and the likelihood that it will become irreversible\\nare increased with higher doses and longer periods of\\ntreatment. The syndrome can develop after short treat-\\nment periods at low doses. Anticholinergic agents may\\nworsen these effects. Clozapine has occasionally been\\nuseful in controlling the TD caused by other antipsychot-\\nic drugs.\\nAgranulocytosis has been associated with clozapine.\\nThis is a potentially fatal reaction, but can be prevented\\nwith careful monitoring of the white blood count. There\\nare no well-established risk factors for developing agran-\\nulocytosis, and so all patients treated with this drug must\\nfollow the clozapine Patient Management System. For\\nmore information, call 1-800-448-5938.\\nAnticholinergic effects, particularly dry mouth ,\\nhave been reported with all of the phenothiazines, and\\ncan be severe enough to cause patients to discontinue\\ntheir medication.\\nPhotosensitization is a common reaction to chlor-\\npromazine.

The best known of this group is HIV , human\\nimmunodeficiencyvirus, the causative agent of AIDS.\\nPurpose\\nAntiretroviral agents are virustatic agents which\\nblock steps in the replication of the virus. The drugs are\\nnot curative; however continued use of drugs, particular-\\nly in multi-drug regimens, significantly slows disease\\nprogression.\\nDescription\\nThere are three main types of antiretroviral drugs,\\nalthough only two steps in the viral replications process\\nare blocked. Nucleoside analogs, or nucleoside reverse\\ntranscriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), such as didanosine (ddI,\\nVidex), lamivudine (3TC, Epivir), stavudine (d4T, Zerit),\\nzalcitabine (ddC, Hivid), and zidovudine (AZT, Retrovir),\\nact by inhibiting the enzyme reverse transcriptase.\\nBecause a retrovirus is composed of RNA, the virus must\\nmake a DNA strand in order to replicate itself. Reverse\\ntranscriptase is an enzyme that is essential to making the\\nDNA copy. The nucleoside reverse transcriptase\\ninhibitors are incorporated into the DNA strand. This is a\\nfaulty DNA molecule which is incapable of reproducing.\\nThe non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase in-\\nhibitors (NNRTIs), such as delavirdine (Rescriptor),\\nloviride, and nevirapine (Viramune) act by binding\\ndirectly to the reverse transcriptase molecule, inhibiting\\nits activity.\\nProtease inhibitors , such as indinavir (Crixivan),\\nnelfinavir (Viracept), ritonavir (Norvir), and saquinavir\\n(Invirase) act on the enzyme protease, which is essential\\nfor the virus to break down the proteins in infected cells.\\nWithout this essential step, the virus produces immature\\ncopies of itself, which are non-infectious.\\nBecause HIV mutates readily, the virus can develop\\nresistance to single drug therapy. However, treatment\\nwith drug combinations appears to produce a durable\\nresponse. Proper treatment appears to slow the progres-\\nsion of HIV infections and reduce the frequency of\\nopportunistic infections.\\nRecommended dosage\\nDoses must be individualized based on the patient,\\nand use of interacting drugs. The optimum combinations\\nof antiretroviral drugs have not been determined, nor is\\nthere agreement on the stage of infection at which to start\\ntreatment.\\nPrecautions\\nAlthough the antiretroviral drugs fall into three\\ngroups, each drug has a unique pattern of adverse effects\\nand drug interactions. Since the drugs are used in various\\ncombinations, the frequency and severity of adverse\\neffects will vary with the combination. Although most\\ndrug combinations show a higher rate of adverse events\\nthat single drug therapy, some patterns are not pre-\\ndictable. For example, indinavir has been reported to\\ncause insomnia in 3% of patients, however, when used\\nin combination with zidovudine, only 1.5% of patients\\ncomplained of sleep difficulties.\\nThe most severe adverse effects associated with the\\nprotease inhibitors are renal and hepatic toxicity.

It\\nis classified as an auto-immune disease, because the dis-\\nease is caused by the body’s own immune system acting\\nagainst the body itself. Symptoms include painful, stiff,\\nswollen joints,fever, fatigue, and loss of appetite.\\nIn recent years, there has been a change in attitude\\nconcerning the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Physi-\\ncians now use Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs\\n(DMARDs) early in the history of the disease and are\\nless inclined to wait for crippling stages before resorting\\nto the more potent drugs. Fuller understanding of the\\nside-effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\\n(NSAIDs) has also stimulated reliance on other types of\\nantirheumatic drugs.\\nDescription\\nThe major classes of antirheumatic drugs include:\\n• Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs.\\nDrugs belonging to this class bring symptomatic relief\\nof both inflammation and pain, but have a limited effect\\non the progressive bone and cartilage loss associated\\nwith rheumatoid arthritis. They act by slowing the\\nbody’s production of prostaglandins. Common NSAIDs\\ninclude: ibuprofen (Motrin, Nuprin or Advil), naproxen\\n(Naprosyn, Aleve) and indomethacin(Indocin).\\n• Corticosteroids . These drugs are very powerful anti-\\ninflammatory agents. They are the synthetic analogs of\\ncortisone, produced by the body. Corticosteroids are\\nused to reduce inflammation and suppress activity of\\nthe immune system. The most commonly prescribed\\nare prednisone and dexamethasone.\\n• Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs).\\nDMARDs influence the disease process itself and do not\\nonly treat symptoms, hence their name. DMARDs also\\nhave anti-inflammatory effects, and most were borrowed\\nfrom the treatment of other diseases, such as cancer and\\nmalaria. Antimalarials DMARDs include chloroquine\\n(Aralen) and hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil). Powerful\\nDMARDs include: methotrexate (Rheumatrex), sul-\\nfasalazine, cyclosporine, azathioprine (Imuran) and\\ncyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), azathioprine, sulfasalazine,\\npenicillamine, and organic gold compounds such as\\naurothioglucose (Solganol), gold sodium thiomalate\\n(Aurolate) and auranofin (Ridaura).\\n• Slow-Acting Antirheumatic Drugs (SAARDs). SAARDs\\nare a special class of DMARDs and the effect of these\\ndrugs is slow acting and not so quickly apparent as that\\nof the NSAIDs. Examples are hydroxychloroquine and\\naurothioglucose.\\n• Immunosuppresive cytotoxic drugs. This class of drugs\\nis used if treatment with NSAIDs and SAARDs have\\nno effect. Immunosuppresive drugs have a stabilizing\\neffect on the immune system. Since the inflammation\\nassociated with chronic arthritis is due to malfunctions\\nof the immune system, use of this class of drugs has\\nbeen shown to be beneficial for the treatment of\\nrheumatoid arthritis as well. Examples are: methotrex-\\nate, mechlorethamine, cyclophosphamide, chlorambu-\\ncil, and azathioprine.\\nRecommended dosage\\nRecommended dosage depends on the type of drug.\\nThe prescribing physician or the pharmacist provide\\ninformation for the correct dosage. The drugs must be\\ntaken exactly as directed.\\nWhen taking methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis,\\nit should be taken only once or twice a week as pre-\\nscribed, not every day. Taking it every day can lead to a\\nfatal overdose.\\nPrecautions\\nMany antirheumatic drugs such as, for example, aza-\\nthioprine (Imuran) and methotrexate (Rheumatrex), are very\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 305\\nAntirheumatic drugs\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 305'),\n",

For practi-\\ncal purposes, antiseptics are routinely thought of as topi-\\ncal agents, for application to skin, mucous membranes,\\nand inanimate objects, although a formal definition\\nincludes agents which are used internally, such as the uri-\\nnary tract antiseptics.\\nPurpose\\nAntiseptics are a diverse class of drugs which are\\napplied to skin surfaces or mucous membranes for their\\nanti-infective effects. This may be either bacteriocidal or\\nbacteriostatic. Their uses include cleansing of skin and\\nwound surfaces after injury, preparation of skin surfaces\\nprior to injections or surgical procedures, and routine disin-\\nfection of the oral cavity as part of a program of oral\\nhygiene. Antiseptics are also used for disinfection of inani-\\nmate objects, including instruments and furniture surfaces.\\nCommonly used antiseptics for skin cleaning include\\nbenzalkonium chloride, chlorhexidine, hexachlorophine,\\niodine compounds, mercury compounds, alcohol and\\nhydrogen peroxide. Other agents which have been used\\nfor this purpose, but have largely been supplanted by\\nmore effective or safer agents, include boric acid and\\nvolatile oils such as methyl salicylate (oil of wintergreen.)\\nChlorhexidine shows a high margin of safety when\\napplied to mucous membranes, and has been used in oral\\nrinses and preoperative total body washes.\\nBenzalkonium chloride and hexachlorophine are used\\nprimarily as hand scrubs or face washes. Benzalkonium may\\nalso find application is a disinfecting agent for instruments,\\nand in low concentration as a preservative for drugs includ-\\ning ophthalmic solutions. Benzalkonium chloride is inacti-\\nvated by organic compounds, including soap, and must not\\nbe applied to areas which have not been fully rinsed.\\nIodine compounds include tincture of iodine and\\npovidone iodine compounds. Iodine compounds have the\\nbroadest spectrum of all topical anti-infectives, with action\\nagainst bacteria, fungi, viruses, spores, protozoa, and\\nyeasts. Iodine tincture is highly effective, but its alcoholic\\ncomponent is drying and extremely irritating when applied\\nto abraided (scraped or rubbed) skin. Povidone iodine, an\\norganic compound, is less irritating and less toxic, but not\\nas effective. Povidone iodine has been used for hand\\nscrubs and disinfection of surgical sites. Aqueous solu-\\ntions of iodine have also been used as antiseptic agents,\\nbut are less effective than alcoholic solutions and less con-\\nvenient to use that the povidone iodine compounds.\\nHydrogen peroxide acts through the liberation of\\noxygen gas. Although the antibacterial activity of hydro-\\ngen peroxide is relatively weak, the liberation of oxygen\\nbubbles produces an effervescent action, which may be\\nuseful for wound cleansing through removal of tissue\\ndebris. The activity of hydrogen peroxide may be\\nreduced by the presence of blood and pus. The appropri-\\nate concentration of hydrogen peroxide for antiseptic use\\nis 3%, although higher concentrations are available.\\nThimerosol (Mersol) is a mercury compound with\\nactivity against bacteria and yeasts. Prolonged use may\\nresult in mercury toxicity.\\nRecommended dosage\\nDosage varies with product and intended use.

Traditionally, they were used to treat stom-\\nach ulcers, but for this purpose they have largely been\\nreplaced by the acid inhibiting compoundsa, the H-2\\nreceptor blockers such as cimetidine and ranitidine and\\nthe proton pump inhibtors such as omeprazole, lansopra-\\nzole and rabetazole.\\nMost of the drugs used for this purpose as “anti-\\ncholinergics”, since they counteract the effects of the\\nneurohormone acetylcholine. Some of these drugs are\\nderived from the plant belladonna, also known as Deadly\\nNightshade. There is also a group of drugs with similar\\nactivity, but not taken from plant sources. The anti-\\ncholingergics decrease both the movements of the stom-\\nach and intestine, and also the secretions of stomach acid\\nand digestive enzymes.

In some cases, gas-\\ntric acid secretion is completely blocked for over 24 hours\\non a single dose. In addition to their role in treatment of\\ngastric ulcers, the proton pump inhibitors are used to treat\\nsyndromes of excessive acid secretion (Zollinger-Ellison\\nSyndrome) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).\\nHistamine H-2 receptor blockers stop the action of\\nhistamine on the gastric parietal cells, inhibiting the secre-\\ntion of gastric acid. These drugs are less effective than the\\nproton pump inhibitors, but may achieve a 75–79% reduc-\\ntion in acid secretion. Higher rates of acid inhibition may\\nbe achieved when the drug is administered by the intra-\\nvenous route. The H-2 receptor blockers may also be used\\nto treat heartburn and hypersecretory syndromes. When\\ngiven before surgery, the H-2 receptor blockers are useful\\nin prevention of aspiration pneumonia.\\nSucralfate (Carafate), a substituted sugar molecule\\nwith no nutritional value, does not inhibit gastric acid, but\\nrather, reacts with existing stomach acid to form a thick\\ncoating that covers the surface of an ulcer, protecting the\\nopen area from further damage. A secondary effect is to\\nact as an inhibitor of the digestive enzyme pepsin. Sucral-\\nfate does not bind to the normal stomach lining. The drug\\nhas been used for prevention of stress ulcers, the type\\nseen in patients exposed to physical stress such as burns\\nand surgery. It has no systemic effects.\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe doses of the proton pump inhibitors and H-2\\nreceptor blockers vary depending on the drug and condi-\\ntion being treated. Consult individual references.\\nThe dose of sucralfate for acute ulcer therapy is 1\\ngram four times a day. After the ulcer has healed, mainte-\\nnance treatment may continue at 1 gram two times daily.\\nPrecautions\\nThe proton pump inhibitors are generally well toler-\\nated, and the most common adverse effects are diarrhea,\\nitching , skin rash, dizziness and headache . Muscle\\naches and a higher than normal rate of respiratory infec-\\ntions are among the other adverse reactions reported.\\nOmeprazole has an increased rate of fetal deaths in ani-\\nmal studies.

Uretsky, PharmD\\nAnxiety\\nDefinition\\nAnxiety is a multisystem response to a perceived\\nthreat or danger. It reflects a combination of biochemical\\nchanges in the body, the patient’s personal history and\\nmemory, and the social situation. As far as we know, anxi-\\nety is a uniquely human experience. Other animals clearly\\nknow fear, but human anxiety involves an ability, to use\\nmemory and imagination to move backward and forward\\nin time, that animals do not appear to have. The anxiety\\nthat occurs in post-traumatic syndromes indicates that\\nhuman memory is a much more complicated mental func-\\ntion than animal memory. Moreover, a large portion of\\nhuman anxiety is produced by anticipation of future\\nevents. Without a sense of personal continuity over time,\\npeople would not have the “raw materials” of anxiety.\\nIt is important to distinguish between anxiety as a\\nfeeling or experience, and an anxiety disorder as a psy-\\nchiatric diagnosis. A person may feel anxious without\\nhaving an anxiety disorder. Also a person facing a clear\\nand present danger or a realistic fear is not usually con-\\nsidered to be in a state of anxiety. In addition, anxiety\\nfrequently occurs as a symptom in other categories of\\npsychiatric disturbance.\\nDescription\\nAlthough anxiety is a commonplace experience that\\neveryone has from time to time, it is difficult to describe\\nconcretely because it has so many different potential caus-\\nes and degrees of intensity. Doctors sometimes categorize\\nanxiety as an emotion or an affect depending on whether it\\nis being described by the person having it (emotion) or by\\nan outside observer (affect). The word emotion is general-\\nly used for the biochemical changes and feeling state that\\nunderlie a person’s internal sense of anxiety. Affect is used\\nto describe the person’s emotional state from an observer’s\\nperspective. If a doctor says that a patient has an anxious\\naffect, he or she means that the patient appears nervous or\\nanxious, or responds to others in an anxious way (for\\nexample, the individual is shaky, tremulous, etc.).\\nAlthough anxiety is related to fear, it is not the same\\nthing. Fear is a direct, focused response to a specific event\\nor object, and the person is consciously aware of it. Most\\npeople will feel fear if someone points a loaded gun at\\nthem or if they see a tornado forming on the horizon. They\\nalso will recognize that they are afraid. Anxiety, on the\\nother hand, is often unfocused, vague, and hard to pin\\ndown to a specific cause. In this form it is called free-float-\\ning anxiety. Sometimes anxiety being experienced in the\\npresent may stem from an event or person that produced\\npainand fear in the past, but the anxious individual is not\\nconsciously aware of the original source of the feeling. It\\nis anxiety’s aspect of remoteness that makes it hard for\\npeople to compare their experiences of it. Whereas most\\npeople will be fearful in physically dangerous situations,\\nand can agree that fear is an appropriate response in the\\npresence of danger, anxiety is often triggered by objects or\\nevents that are unique and specific to an individual. An\\nindividual might be anxious because of a unique meaning\\nor memory being stimulated by present circumstances, not\\nbecause of some immediate danger. Another individual\\nlooking at the anxious person from the outside may be\\ntruly puzzled as to the reason for the person’s anxiety.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAnxiety can have a number of different causes. It is\\na multidimensional response to stimuli in the person’s\\nenvironment, or a response to an internal stimulus (for\\nexample, a hypochondriac’s reaction to a stomach rum-\\nbling) resulting from a combination of general biological\\nand individual psychological processes.\\nPhysical\\nIn some cases, anxiety is produced by physical respons-\\nes to stress, or by certain disease processes or medications.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 317\\nAnxiety\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 317'),\n",

This response is the human organ-\\nism’s automatic “red alert” in a life-threatening situation.\\nIt is a state of physiological and emotional hyperarousal\\nmarked by high muscle tension and strong feelings of\\nfear or anger. When a person has a fight-or-flight reac-\\ntion, the level of stress hormones in their blood rises.\\nThey become more alert and attentive, their eyes dilate,\\ntheir heartbeat increases, their breathing rate increases,\\nand their digestion slows down, allowing more energy to\\nbe available to the muscles.\\nThis emergency reaction is regulated by a part of the\\nnervous system called the autonomic nervous system, or\\nANS. The ANS is controlled by the hypothalamus, a spe-\\ncialized part of the brainstem that is among a group of\\nstructures called the limbic system. The limbic system\\ncontrols human emotions through its connections to\\nglands and muscles; it also connects to the ANS and\\n“higher” brain centers, such as parts of the cerebral cor-\\ntex. One problem with this arrangement is that the limbic\\nsystem cannot tell the difference between a realistic\\nphysical threat and an anxiety-producing thought or idea.\\nThe hypothalamus may trigger the release of stress hor-\\nmones by the pituitary gland, even when there is no\\nexternal and objective danger. A second problem is\\ncaused by the biochemical side effects of too many “false\\nalarms” in the ANS. When a person responds to a real\\ndanger, his or her body gets rid of the stress hormones by\\nrunning away or by fighting. In modern life, however,\\npeople often have fight-or-flight reactions in situations in\\nwhich they can neither run away nor lash out physically.\\nAs a result, their bodies have to absorb all the biochemi-\\ncal changes of hyperarousal, rather than release them.\\nThese biochemical changes can produce anxious feel-\\nings, as well as muscle tension and other physical symp-\\ntoms associated with anxiety. They may even produce\\npermanent changes in the brain, if the process occurs\\nrepeatedly. Moreover, chronic physical disorders, such as\\ncoronary artery disease, may be worsened by anxiety,\\nas chronic hyperarousal puts undue stress on the heart,\\nstomach, and other organs.\\nDISEASES AND DISORDERS. Anxiety can be a symp-\\ntom of certain medical conditions. Some of these dis-\\neases are disorders of the endocrine system, such as\\nCushing’s syndrome(overproduction of cortisol by the\\nadrenal cortex), and include over- or underactivity of the\\nthyroid gland. Other medical conditions that can produce\\nanxiety include respiratory distress syndrome , mitral\\nvalve prolapse , porphyria, and chest pain caused by\\ninadequate blood supply to the heart (angina pectoris).\\nMEDICATIONS AND SUBSTANCE USE. Numerous\\nmedications may cause anxiety-like symptoms as a side\\neffect. They include birth control pills; some thyroid or\\nasthmadrugs; some psychotropic agents; occasionally,\\nlocal anesthetics; corticosteroids ; antihypertensive\\ndrugs; and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (like\\nflurbiprofen and ibuprofen).\\nAlthough people do not usually think of caffeine as\\na drug, it can cause anxiety-like symptoms when con-\\nsumed in sufficient quantity. Patients who consume caf-\\nfeine rich foods and beverages, such as chocolate, cocoa,\\ncoffee, tea, or carbonated soft drinks (especially cola\\nbeverages), can sometimes lower their anxiety symptoms\\nsimply by reducing their intake of these substances.\\nWithdrawal from certain prescription drugs, primari-\\nly beta blockers and corticosteroids, can cause anxiety.\\nWithdrawal from drugs of abuse, including LSD,\\ncocaine, alcohol, and opiates, can also cause anxiety.\\nLearned associations\\nSome aspects of anxiety appear to be unavoidable\\nbyproducts of the human developmental process.\\nHumans are unique among animals in that they spend an\\nunusually long period of early life in a relatively helpless\\ncondition, and a sense of helplessness can lead to anxi-\\nety. The extended period of human dependency on adults\\nmeans that people may remember, and learn to antici-\\npate, frightening or upsetting experiences long before\\nthey are capable enough to feel a sense of mastery over\\ntheir environment. In addition, the fact that anxiety dis-\\norders often run in families indicates that children can\\nlearn unhealthy attitudes and behaviors from parents, as\\nwell as healthy ones. Also, recurrent disorders in families\\nmay indicate that there is a genetic or inherited compo-\\nnent in some anxiety disorders. For example, there has\\nbeen found to be a higher rate of anxiety disorders\\n(panic) in identical twins than in fraternal twins.\\nCHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT AND ANXIETY. Re-\\nsearchers in early childhood development regard anxiety\\nin adult life as a residue of childhood memories of\\ndependency. Humans learn during the first year of life\\nthat they are not self-sufficient and that their basic sur-\\nvival depends on the care of others. It is thought that this\\nearly experience of helplessness underlies the most com-\\nmon anxieties of adult life, including fear of powerless-\\nness and fear of being unloved. Thus, adults can be made\\nanxious by symbolic threats to their sense of competence\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2318\\nAnxiety\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 318'),\n",

The psychoanalytic model gives\\nconsiderable weight to the symbolic aspect of human\\nanxiety; examples include phobic disorders, obsessions,\\ncompulsions, and other forms of anxiety that are highly\\nindividualized. The length of the human maturation\\nprocess allows many opportunities for children and ado-\\nlescents to connect their experiences with certain objects\\nor events that can bring back feelings in later life. For\\nexample, a person who was frightened as a child by a tall\\nman wearing glasses may feel panicky years later by\\nsomething that reminds him of that person or experience\\nwithout consciously knowing why.\\nFreud thought that anxiety results from a person’s\\ninternal conflicts. According to his theory, people feel\\nanxious when they feel torn between desires or urges\\ntoward certain actions, on the one hand, and moral\\nrestrictions, on the other. In some cases, the person’s\\nanxiety may attach itself to an object that represents the\\ninner conflict. For example, someone who feels anxious\\naround money may be pulled between a desire to steal\\nand the belief that stealing is wrong. Money becomes a\\nsymbol for the inner conflict between doing what is con-\\nsidered right and doing what one wants.\\nPHOBIAS. Phobias are a special type of anxiety\\nreaction in which the person’s anxiety is concentrated on\\na specific object or situation that the person then tries to\\navoid. In most cases, the person’s fear is out of all pro-\\nportion to its “cause.” Prior to the Diagnostic and Statis-\\ntical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV),\\nthese specific phobias were called simple phobias. It is\\nestimated that 10-11% of the population will develop a\\nphobia in the course of their lives. Some phobias, such as\\nagoraphobia(fear of open spaces), claustrophobia (fear\\nof small or confined spaces), and social phobia, are\\nshared by large numbers of people. Others are less com-\\nmon or unique to the patient.\\nSocial and environmental stressors\\nAnxiety often has a social dimension because\\nhumans are social creatures. People frequently report\\nfeelings of high anxiety when they anticipate and, there-\\nfore, fear the loss of social approval or love. Social phobia\\nis a specific anxiety disorder that is marked by high levels\\nof anxiety or fear of embarrassment in social situations.\\nAnother social stressor is prejudice. People who\\nbelong to groups that are targets of bias are at higher risk\\nfor developing anxiety disorders. Some experts think, for\\nexample, that the higher rates of phobias and panic dis-\\norder among women reflects their greater social and\\neconomic vulnerability.\\nSome controversial studies indicate that the increase\\nin violent or upsetting pictures and stories in news\\nreports and entertainment may raise the anxiety level of\\nmany people. Stress and anxiety management programs\\noften suggest that patients cut down their exposure to\\nupsetting stimuli.\\nAnxiety may also be caused by environmental or\\noccupational factors. People who must live or work\\naround sudden or loud noises, bright or flashing lights,\\nchemical vapors, or similar nuisances, which they cannot\\navoid or control, may develop heightened anxiety levels.\\nExistential anxiety\\nAnother factor that shapes human experiences of\\nanxiety is knowledge of personal mortality. Humans are\\nthe only animals that appear to be aware of their limited\\nlife span. Some researchers think that awareness of\\ndeathinfluences experiences of anxiety from the time\\nthat a person is old enough to understand death.\\nSymptoms of anxiety\\nIn order to understand the diagnosis and treatment of\\nanxiety, it is helpful to have a basic understanding of its\\nsymptoms.\\nSOMATIC. The somatic or physical symptoms of\\nanxiety include headaches, dizziness or lightheadedness,\\nnausea and/or vomiting, diarrhea , tingling, pale com-\\nplexion, sweating, numbness, difficulty in breathing, and\\nsensations of tightness in the chest, neck, shoulders, or\\nhands. These symptoms are produced by the hormonal,\\nmuscular, and cardiovascular reactions involved in the\\nfight-or-flight reaction.\\nBEHAVIORAL. Behavioral symptoms of anxiety\\ninclude pacing, trembling, general restlessness, hyper-\\nventilation, pressured speech, hand wringing, or finger\\ntapping.\\nCOGNITIVE. Cognitive symptoms of anxiety include\\nrecurrent or obsessive thoughts, feelings of doom, mor-\\nbid or fear-inducing thoughts or ideas, and confusion, or\\ninability to concentrate.\\nEMOTIONAL. Feeling states associated with anxiety\\ninclude tension or nervousness, feeling “hyper” or\\n“keyed up,” and feelings of unreality, panic, or terror.\\nDEFENSE MECHANISMS. In psychoanalytic theory,\\nthe symptoms of anxiety in humans may arise from or\\nactivate a number of unconscious defense mechanisms.\\nBecause of these defenses, it is possible for a person to\\nbe anxious without being consciously aware of it or\\nappearing anxious to others. These psychological defens-\\nes include:\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 319\\nAnxiety\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 319'),\n",

Anxiety from one source is attached to a\\ndifferent object or event. Phobias are an example of the\\nmechanism of displacement in psychoanalytic theory.\\n• Rationalization. The person justifies the anxious feel-\\nings by saying that any normal person would feel anx-\\nious in their situation.\\n• Somatization. The anxiety emerges in the form of phys-\\nical complaints and illnesses, such as recurrent\\nheadaches, stomach upsets, or muscle and joint pain.\\n• Delusion formation. The person converts anxious feel-\\nings into conspiracy theories or similar ideas without\\nreality testing. Delusion formation can involve groups\\nas well as individuals.\\nOther theorists attribute some drug addiction to the\\ndesire to relieve symptoms of anxiety. Most addictions,\\nthey argue, originate in the use of mood-altering sub-\\nstances or behaviors to “medicate” anxious feelings.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of anxiety is difficult and complex\\nbecause of the variety of its causes and the highly personal-\\nized and individualized nature of its symptom formation.\\nThere are no medical tests that can be used to diagnose\\nanxiety by itself. When a doctor examines an anxious\\npatient, he or she will first rule out physical conditions and\\ndiseases that have anxiety as a symptom. Apart from these\\nexclusions, the physical examinationis usually inconclu-\\nsive. Some anxious patients may have their blood pressure\\nor pulse rate affected by anxiety, or may look pale or per-\\nspire heavily, but others may appear physically completely\\nnormal. The doctor will then take the patient’s medication,\\ndietary, and occupational history to see if they are taking\\nprescription drugs that might cause anxiety, if they are\\nabusing alcohol or mood-altering drugs, if they are con-\\nsuming large amounts of caffeine, or if their workplace is\\nnoisy or dangerous. In most cases, the most important\\nsource of diagnostic information is the patient’s psycholog-\\nical and social history. The doctor may administer a brief\\npsychological test to help evaluate the intensity of the\\npatient’s anxiety and some of its features. Some tests that\\nare often given include the Hamilton Anxiety Scale and the\\nAnxiety Disorders Interview Schedule (ADIS). Many doc-\\ntors will check a number of chemical factors in the blood,\\nsuch as the level of thyroid hormone and blood sugar.\\nTreatment\\nNot all patients with anxiety require treatment, but\\nfor more severe cases, treatment is recommended.\\nBecause anxiety often has more than one cause and is\\nexperienced in highly individual ways, its treatment usu-\\nally requires more than one type of therapy. In addition,\\nthere is no way to tell in advance how patients will\\nrespond to a specific drug or therapy. Sometimes the doc-\\ntor will need to try different medications or methods of\\ntreatment before finding the best combination for the\\nparticular patient. It usually takes about six to eight\\nweeks for the doctor to evaluate the effectiveness of a\\ntreatment regimen.\\nMedications\\nMedications are often prescribed to relieve the phys-\\nical and psychological symptoms of anxiety. Most agents\\nwork by counteracting the biochemical and muscular\\nchanges involved in the fight-or-flight reaction. Some\\nwork directly on the chemicals in the brain that are\\nthought to underlie the anxiety.\\nANXIOLYTICS. Anxiolytics are sometimes called\\ntranquilizers. Most anxiolytic drugs are either benzodi-\\nazepines or barbiturates. Barbiturates, once commonly\\nused, are now rarely used in clinical practice. Barbitu-\\nrates work by slowing down the transmission of nerve\\nimpulses from the brain to other parts of the body. They\\ninclude such drugs as phenobarbital (Luminal) and pen-\\ntobarbital (Nembutal). Benzodiazepines work by relax-\\ning the skeletal muscles and calming the limbic system.\\nThey include such drugs as chlordiazepoxide (Librium)\\nand diazepam (Valium). Both barbiturates and benzodi-\\nazepines are potentially habit-forming and may cause\\nwithdrawal symptoms, but benzodiazepines are far less\\nlikely than barbiturates to cause physical dependency.\\nBoth drugs also increase the effects of alcohol and\\nshould never be taken in combination with it.\\nTwo other types of anxiolytic medications include\\nmeprobamate (Equanil), which is now rarely used, and\\nbuspirone (BuSpar), a new type of anxiolytic that appears\\nto work by increasing the efficiency of the body’s own\\nemotion-regulating brain chemicals. Buspirone has sever-\\nal advantages over other anxiolytics. It does not cause\\ndependence problems, does not interact with alcohol, and\\ndoes not affect the patient’s ability to drive or operate\\nmachinery. However, buspirone is not effective against\\ncertain types of anxiety, such as panic disorder.\\nANTIDEPRESSANTS AND BETA-BLOCKERS. For some\\nanxiety disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disor-\\nder and panic type anxiety, a type of drugs used to treat\\ndepression, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors\\n(SSRIs; such as Prozac and Paxil), are the treatment of\\nchoice.

They include\\ndrugs like propranolol (Inderal) or atenolol (Tenormin).\\nBeta-blockers are sometimes given to patients with post-\\ntraumatic anxiety symptoms. More commonly, the beta-\\nblockers are given to patients with a mild form of social\\nphobic anxiety, such as fear of public speaking.\\nPsychotherapy\\nMost patients with anxiety will be given some form of\\npsychotherapy along with medications. Many patients\\nbenefit from insight-oriented therapies, which are\\ndesigned to help them uncover unconscious conflicts and\\ndefense mechanisms in order to understand how their\\nsymptoms developed. Patients who are extremely anxious\\nmay benefit from supportive psychotherapy, which aims at\\nsymptom reduction rather than personality restructuring.\\nTwo newer approaches that work well with anxious\\npatients are cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and\\nrelaxation training. In CBT, the patient is taught to identify\\nthe thoughts and situations that stimulate his or her anxi-\\nety, and to view them more realistically. In the behavioral\\npart of the program, the patient is exposed to the anxiety-\\nprovoking object, situation, or internal stimulus (like a\\nrapid heart beat) in gradual stages until he or she is desen-\\nsitized to it. Relaxation training, which is sometimes\\ncalled anxiety management training, includes breathing\\nexercises and similar techniques intended to help the\\npatient prevent hyperventilation and relieve the muscle\\ntension associated with the fight-or-flight reaction. Both\\nCBT and relaxation training can be used in group therapy\\nas well as individual treatment. In addition to CBT, sup-\\nport groups are often helpful to anxious patients, because\\nthey provide a social network and lessen the embarrass-\\nment that often accompanies anxiety symptoms.\\nPsychosurgery\\nSurgery on the brain is very rarely recommended for\\npatients with anxiety; however, some patients with severe\\ncases of obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD) have\\nbeen helped by an operation on a part of the brain that is\\ninvolved in OCD. Normally, this operation is attempted\\nafter all other treatments have failed.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative treatments for anxiety cover a variety of\\napproaches. Meditation and mindfulness training are\\nthought beneficial to patients with phobias and panic disor-\\nder. Hydrotherapy is useful to some anxious patients\\nbecause it promotes general relaxation of the nervous sys-\\ntem. Yoga, aikido,t’ai chi, and dance therapy help patients\\nwork with the physical, as well as the emotional, tensions\\nthat either promote anxiety or are created by the anxiety.\\nHomeopathy and traditional Chinese medicine\\napproach anxiety as a symptom of a systemic disorder.\\nHomeopathic practitioners select a remedy based on\\nother associated symptoms and the patient’s general con-\\nstitution. Chinese medicine regards anxiety as a blockage\\nof qi, or vital force, inside the patient’s body that is most\\nlikely to affect the lung and large intestine meridian flow.\\nThe practitioner of Chinese medicine chooses acupunc-\\nture point locations and/or herbal therapy to move the qi\\nand rebalance the entire system in relation to the lung\\nand large intestine.\\nAromatherapy using essential oils can also be ben-\\neficial in treating patients with anxiety. The oils go\\ndirectly to the brain via the olfactory nerve (which con-\\ntrols smell) and can have direct affect on calming the ner-\\nvous system.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for resolution of anxiety depends on\\nthe specific disorder and a wide variety of factors,\\nincluding the patient’s age, sex, general health, living sit-\\nuation, belief system, social support network, and\\nresponses to different anxiolytic medications and forms\\nof therapy.\\nPrevention\\nHumans have significant control over thoughts, and,\\ntherefore, may learn ways of preventing anxiety by\\nchanging irrational ideas and beliefs. Humans also have\\nsome power over anxiety arising from social and envi-\\nronmental conditions. Other forms of anxiety, however,\\nare built into the human organism and its life cycle, and\\ncannot be prevented or eliminated.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\n“Anxiety Disorders.” In Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of\\nMental Disorders. 4th ed.

Although anxiety is a commonplace experience, not\\neveryone who experiences it has an anxiety disorder. Anx-\\niety is associated with a wide range of physical illnesses,\\nmedication side effects, and other psychiatric disorders.\\nThe revisions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Man-\\nual of Mental Disorders (DSM) that took place after\\n1980 brought major changes in the classification of the\\nanxiety disorders. Prior to 1980, psychiatrists classified\\npatients on the basis of a theory of causality that defined\\nanxiety as the outcome of unconscious conflicts in the\\npatient’s mind. DSM-III (1980), DSM-III-R (1987), and\\nDSM-IV (1994) introduced and refined a new classifica-\\ntion that took into consideration recent discoveries about\\nthe biochemical and post-traumatic origins of some types\\nof anxiety. The present definitions are based on the exter-\\nnal and reported symptom patterns of the disorders rather\\nthan on theories about their origins.\\nDescription\\nAnxiety disorders are the most common form of\\nmental disturbance in the United States population. It is\\nestimated that 28 million persons suffer from an anxiety\\ndisorder every year. These disorders are a serious prob-\\nlem for the entire society because of their interference\\nwith patients’ work, schooling, and family life. They also\\ncontribute to the high rates of alcohol and substance\\nabuse in the United States. Anxiety disorders are an addi-\\ntional problem for health professionals because the phys-\\nical symptoms of anxiety frequently bring people to pri-\\nmary care doctors or emergency rooms.\\nDSM-IV defines twelve types of anxiety disorders in\\nthe adult population. They can be grouped under seven\\nheadings:\\n• Panic disorders with or without agoraphobia . The\\nchief characteristic of panic disorder is the occurrence\\nof panic attacks coupled with fear of their recurrence.\\nIn clinical settings, agoraphobia is usually not a disor-\\nder by itself, but is typically associated with some form\\nof panic disorder. Patients with agoraphobia are afraid\\nof places or situations in which they might have a panic\\nattack and be unable to leave or to find help. About\\n25% of patients with panic disorder develop obsessive-\\ncompulsive disorder (OCD).\\n• Phobias . These include specific phobias and social\\nphobia.

Some phobias concern activities or objects that\\ninvolve some risk (for example, flying or driving) but\\nmany are focused on harmless animals or other objects.\\nSocial phobia involves a fear of being humiliated,\\njudged, or scrutinized. It manifests itself as a fear of\\nperforming certain functions in the presence of others,\\nsuch as public speaking or using public lavatories.\\n• Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). This disorder is\\nmarked by unwanted, intrusive, persistent thoughts or\\nrepetitive behaviors that reflect the patient’s anxiety or\\nattempts to control it. It affects between 2-3% of the\\npopulation and is much more common than was previ-\\nously thought.\\n• Stress disorders. These include post-traumatic stress\\ndisorder (PTSD) and acute stress disorder. Stress dis-\\norders are symptomatic reactions to traumatic events in\\nthe patient’s life.\\n• Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). GAD is the\\nmost commonly diagnosed anxiety disorder and occurs\\nmost frequently in young adults.\\n• Anxiety disorders due to known physical causes. These\\ninclude general medical conditions or substance abuse.\\n• Anxiety disorder not otherwise specified. This last cate-\\ngory is not a separate type of disorder, but is included to\\ncover symptoms that do not meet the specific DSM-IV\\ncriteria for other anxiety disorders.\\nAll DSM-IV anxiety disorder diagnoses include a\\ncriterion of severity. The anxiety must be severe enough\\nto interfere significantly with the patient’s occupational\\nor educational functioning, social activities or close rela-\\ntionships, and other customary activities.\\nThe anxiety disorders vary widely in their frequency\\nof occurrence in the general population, age of onset,\\nfamily patterns, and gender distribution. The stress disor-\\nders and anxiety disorders caused by medical conditions\\nor substance abuse are less age- and gender-specific.\\nWhereas OCD affects males and females equally, GAD,\\npanic disorder, and specific phobias all affect women\\nmore frequently than men. GAD and panic disorders are\\nmore likely to develop in young adults, while phobias\\nand OCD can begin in childhood.\\nAnxiety disorders in children and adolescents\\nDSM-IV defines one anxiety disorder as specific to\\nchildren, namely, separation anxiety disorder. This disor-\\nder is defined as anxiety regarding separation from home\\nor family that is excessive or inappropriate for the child’s\\nage. In some children, separation anxiety takes the form\\nof school avoidance.\\nChildren and adolescents can also be diagnosed with\\npanic disorder, phobias, generalized anxiety disorder,\\nand the post- traumatic stress syndromes.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe causes of anxiety include a variety of individual\\nand general social factors, and may produce physical,\\ncognitive, emotional, or behavioral symptoms. The\\npatient’s ethnic or cultural background may also influ-\\nence his or her vulnerability to certain forms of anxiety.\\nGenetic factors that lead to biochemical abnormalities\\nmay also play a role.\\nAnxiety in children may be caused by suffering from\\nabuse, as well as by the factors that cause anxiety in adults.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of anxiety disorders is complicated by\\nthe variety of causes of anxiety and the range of disor-\\nders that may include anxiety as a symptom. Many\\npatients who suffer from anxiety disorders have features\\nor symptoms of more than one disorder. Patients whose\\nanxiety is accounted for by another psychic disorder,\\nsuch as schizophrenia or major depression, are not diag-\\nnosed with an anxiety disorder. A doctor examining an\\nanxious patient will usually begin by ruling out diseases\\nthat are known to cause anxiety and then proceed to take\\nthe patient’s medication history, in order to exclude side\\neffects of prescription drugs. Most doctors will ask about\\ncaffeineconsumption to see if the patient’s dietary habits\\nare a factor. The patient’s work and family situation will\\nalso be discussed. Laboratory tests for blood sugar and\\nthyroid function are also common\\nDiagnostic testing for anxiety\\nThere are no laboratory tests that can diagnose anxi-\\nety, although the doctor may order some specific tests to\\nrule out disease conditions. Although there is no psychi-\\natric test that can provide definite diagnoses of anxiety dis-\\norders, there are several short-answer interviews or symp-\\ntom inventories that doctors can use to evaluate the inten-\\nsity of a patient’s anxiety and some of its associated fea-\\ntures. These measures include the Hamilton Anxiety Scale\\nand the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule (ADIS).\\nTreatment\\nFor relatively mild anxiety disorders, psychotherapy\\nalone may suffice.

Because of the\\nvariety of medications and treatment approaches that are\\nused to treat anxiety disorders, the doctor cannot predict\\nin advance which combination will be most helpful to a\\nspecific patient. In many cases the doctor will need to try\\na new medication or treatment over a six- to eight-week\\nperiod in order to assess its effectiveness. Treatment trials\\ndo not necessarily mean that the patient cannot be helped\\nor that the doctor is incompetent.\\nAlthough anxiety disorders are not always easy to\\ndiagnose, there are several reasons why it is important for\\npatients with severe anxiety symptoms to get help. Anxi-\\nety doesn’t always go away by itself; it often progresses to\\npanic attacks, phobias, and episodes of depression.\\nUntreated anxiety disorders may eventually lead to a diag-\\nnosis of major depression, or interfere with the patient’s\\neducation or ability to keep a job. In addition, many anx-\\nious patients develop addictions to drugs or alcohol when\\nthey try to “medicate” their symptoms. Moreover, since\\nchildren learn ways of coping with anxiety from their par-\\nents, adults who get help for anxiety disorders are in a bet-\\nter position to help their families cope with factors that\\nlead to anxiety than those who remain untreated.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative treatments for anxiety cover a variety of\\napproaches. Meditation and mindfulness training are\\nthought beneficial to patients with phobias and panic disor-\\nder. Hydrotherapy is useful to some anxious patients\\nbecause it promotes general relaxation of the nervous sys-\\ntem.

The aorta, which can develop\\nthese abnormal bulges, is the large blood vessel that car-\\nries oxygen-rich blood away from the heart to the rest of\\nthe body.\\nDescription\\nThe aorta carries oxygen-rich blood to the body, and\\nis therefore called an artery. Because the aorta is an\\nartery, its walls are made of up three layers; a thin inner\\nlayer, a muscular middle layer (that gives the vessel its\\nflexibility under pressure from the filling blood), and a\\nfiber-like outer layer that gives the vessel strength to not\\nburst when the heart pumps blood to the body.\\nAortic aneurysms occur when a weakness develops\\nin part of the wall of the aorta; three basic types are usual-\\nly found. If all three layers of the vessel are affected and\\nweakness develops along an extended area of the vessel,\\nthe weakened area will appear as a large, bulging region\\nof blood vessel; this is called a fusiform aneurysm. If\\nweakness develops between the inner and outer layers of\\nthe aortic wall, a bulge results as blood from the interior\\nof the vessel is pushed around the damaged region in the\\nwall and collects between these layers. This is called a\\ndissecting aneurysm because one layer is “dissected” or\\nseparated from another. If damage occurs to only the mid-\\ndle (muscular) layer of the vessel, a sack-like bulge can\\nform; therefore, this is a saccular aneurysm.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAortic aneurysms occur in different portions of the\\naorta, which begins in the chest (at the heart) and travels\\ndownward through the abdomen. Aneurysms found in\\nthe region of the aorta within the chest are called thoracic\\naortic aneurysms. Aneurysms that occur in the part of the\\naorta within the abdomen are called abdominal aortic\\naneurysms.\\nThoracic aortic aneurysms do not usually produce\\nany noticeable symptoms. However, as the aneurysm\\nbecomes larger, chest, shoulder, neck, lower back, or\\nabdominal pain can result. Abdominal aortic aneurysms\\noccur more often in men, and these aneurysms can cause\\npain in the lower back, hips, and abdomen. A painful\\nabdominal aortic aneurysm usually means that the\\naneurysm could burst very soon.\\nMost abdominal aortic aneurysms are caused by\\natherosclerosis , a condition caused when fat (mostly\\ncholesterol) carried in the blood builds up in the inner\\nwall of the aorta. As more and more fat attaches to the\\naortic wall, the wall itself becomes abnormally weak and\\noften results in an aneurysm or bulge.\\nAortic aneurysms are also caused by a breakdown of\\nthe muscular middle layer of the artery wall, by high\\nblood pressure, by direct injury to the chest, and although\\nrare, by bacteria that can infect the aorta.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 325\\nAortic aneurysm\\nSurgery being performed to correct aortic aneurysm.

The dissecting aorta usu-\\nally does not burst, but has an abnormal second channel\\nwithin it.\\nDescription\\nA defect in the inner lining of the aorta allows an\\nopening or tear to develop. The aorta is the main artery of\\nthe body and is an area of high blood pressure. When a\\ndefect develops, blood pressure can force the tear to open\\nand allow blood to pass through. Since the blood is under\\npressure, it eventually splits (dissecting) the middle layer\\nof the blood vessel, creating a new channel for blood.\\nThe length of the channel grows over time and can result\\nin the closing off of connection points to other arteries.\\nThis can lead to heart attack , strokes, abdominal pain,\\nand nerve damage. Blood may leak from the dissection\\nand collect in the chest an around the heart.\\nA second mechanism leading to aortic dissection is\\nmedial hemorrhage. A medial hemorrhage occurs in the\\nmiddle layer of the blood vessel and spills through the\\ninner lining of the aorta wall. This opening then allows\\nblood from the aorta to enter the vessel wall and begin a\\ndissection. Approximately 2,000 cases of aortic dissec-\\ntion occur yearly in the United States.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAortic dissection is caused by a deterioration of the\\ninner lining of the aorta. There are a number of condi-\\ntions that predispose a person to develop defects of the\\ninner lining, including high blood pressure, Marfan’s dis-\\nease,Ehlers-Danlos syndrome , connective tissue dis-\\neases, and defects of heart development which begin dur-\\ning fetal development. A dissection can also occur acci-\\ndentally following insertion of a catheter, trauma, or\\nsurgery. The main symptom is sudden, intense pain. The\\npain can be so intense as to immobilize the patient and\\ncause him to fall to the ground. The pain is frequently\\nfelt in both the chest and in the back, between the shoul-\\nder blades. The extent of the pain is proportional to the\\nlength of the dissection.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe pain experienced by the patient is the first symp-\\ntom of aortic dissection and is unique. The pain is usually\\ndescribed by the patient as “tearing, ripping, or stabbing.”\\nThis is in contrast to the pain associated with heart\\nattacks. The patient frequently has a reduced or absent\\npulse in the extremities. A murmur may be heard if the\\ndissection is close to the heart. An enlarged aorta will usu-\\nally appear in the chest x rays and ultrasound exams of\\nmost patients. The use of a blood dye in angiograms\\nand/or CT scans (computed tomography scans) will aid\\nin diagnosing and visualizing the dissection.\\nTreatment\\nBecause of the potentially fatal nature of aortic dis-\\nsection, patients are treated immediately. Drugs are\\nadministered to reduce the blood pressure and heart rate.\\nIf the dissection is small, drug therapy alone may be\\nused. In other cases, surgery is performed. In surgery,\\ndamaged sections of the aorta are removed and a synthet-\\nic graft is often used to reconstruct the damaged vessel.\\nPrognosis\\nDepending on the nature and extent of the dissection,\\ndeath can occur within a few hours of the start of a dis-\\nsection.

In aortic valve\\ninsufficiency, the aortic valve becomes leaky, causing\\nblood to flow backwards into the left ventricle.\\nDescription\\nAortic valve insufficiency occurs when this valve\\ncannot properly close after blood that is leaving the\\nheart’s left ventricle enters the aorta. With each contrac-\\ntion of the heart more and more blood flows back into the\\nKEY TERMS\\nDissection—A cut or divide.\\nHemorrhage—A large discharge of blood, profuse\\nbleeding.\\nleft ventricle, causing the ventricle to become overfilled.\\nThis larger-than-normal amount of blood that collects in\\nthe left ventricle puts pressure on the walls of the heart,\\ncausing the heart muscle to increase in thickness (hyper-\\ntrophy). If this thickening continues, the heart can be per-\\nmanently damaged.\\nAortic valve insufficiency is also know as aortic\\nvalve regurgitation because of the abnormal reversed flow\\nof blood leaking through the poorly functioning valve.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe faulty working of the aortic valve can be caused\\nby a birth defect; by abnormal widening of the aorta (which\\ncan be caused by very high blood pressure and a variety of\\nother less common conditions); by various diseases that\\ncause large amounts of swelling (inflammation) in different\\nareas of the body, like rheumatic fever ; and, although\\nrarely, by the sexually transmitted disease,syphilis.\\nAbout 75% of people with aortic valve insufficiency\\nare men. Rheumatic (inflammatory) diseases have been\\nthe main cause of this condition in both men and women.\\nAortic valve insufficiency can remain unnoticed for\\n10 to 15 years. In cases of severe insufficiency a person\\nmay notice a variety of symptoms, including an uncom-\\nfortable pounding of the heart when lying down, a very\\nrapid or hard heart beat (palpitations ), shortness of\\nbreath, chest pain, and if untreated for very long times,\\nswelling of the liver, ankles, and belly.\\nDiagnosis\\nA poorly functioning or insufficient aortic valve can\\nbe identified when a doctor listens to the heart during a\\nphysical examination. A chest x ray, an electrocardio-\\ngram (ECG, an electrical printout of the heart beats), as\\nwell as an echocardiogram (a test that uses sound waves\\nto create an image of the heart and its valves), can further\\nevaluate or confirm the condition.\\nTreatment\\nAortic insufficiency is usually corrected by having\\nthe defective valve surgically replaced. However, such an\\noperation is done in severe cases. Before the condition\\nworsens, certain drugs can be used to help manage this\\ncondition.\\nDrugs that remove water from the body, drugs that\\nlower blood pressure, and drugs that help the heart beat\\nmore effectively can each be used for this condition.\\nReducing the amount of salt in the diet also helps lower\\nthe amount of fluid the body holds and can help the heart\\nto work more efficiently as well.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2328\\nAortic valve insufficiency\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 328'),\n",

Reluc-\\ntantly, she switched her medical specialty to anesthesiol-\\nogy, she embraced her new field with typical intelligence\\nand energy. At this time, anesthesiology was a relatively\\nnew field, having been left by the doctors mostly to the\\nattention of nurses. Apgar realized immediately how\\nmuch in need of scientifically trained personnel was this\\nsignificant part of surgery, and she set out to make anes-\\nthesiology a separate medical discipline. By 1937, she\\nhad become the fiftieth physician to be certified as an\\nanesthesiologist in the United States. The following year\\nshe was appointed director of anesthesiology at the\\nColumbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, becoming the\\nfirst woman to head a department at that institution.\\nAs the attending anesthesiologist who assisted in the\\ndelivery of thousands of babies during these years, Apgar\\nrealized that infants had died from respiratory or circulato-\\nry complications that early treatment could have prevent-\\ned. Apgar decided to bring her considerable research skills\\nto this childbirth dilemma, and her careful study resulted\\nin her publication of the Apgar Score System in 1952.\\n(AP/Wide World Photos.

A person with aphasia may have\\ndifficulty speaking, reading, writing, recognizing the\\nnames of objects, or understanding what other people\\nhave said. Aphasia is caused by a brain injury, as may\\noccur during a traumatic accident or when the brain is\\ndeprived of oxygen during a stroke. It may also be\\ncaused by a brain tumor, a disease such as Alzheimer’s,\\nor an infection, like encephalitis . Aphasia may be tem-\\nporary or permanent. Aphasia does not include speech\\nimpediments caused by loss of muscle control.\\nDescription\\nTo understand and use language effectively, an indi-\\nvidual draws upon word memory—stored information on\\nwhat certain words mean, how to put them together, and\\nhow and when to use them properly. For a majority of\\npeople, these and other language functions are located in\\nthe left side (hemisphere) of the brain. Damage to this\\nside of the brain is most commonly linked to the devel-\\nopment of aphasia. Interestingly, however, left-handed\\npeople appear to have language areas in both the left and\\nright hemispheres of the brain and, as a result, may\\ndevelop aphasia from damage to either side of the brain.\\nStroke is the most common cause of aphasia in the\\nUnited States. Approximately 500,000 individuals suffer\\nstrokes each year, and 20% of these individuals develop\\nsome type of aphasia. Other causes of brain damage\\ninclude head injuries, brain tumors, and infection. About\\nhalf of the people who show signs of aphasia have what\\nis called temporary or transient aphasia and recover com-\\npletely within a few days. An estimated one million\\nAmericans suffer from some form of permanent aphasia.\\nAs yet, no connection between aphasia and age, gender,\\nor race has been found.\\nAphasia is sometimes confused with other conditions\\nthat affect speech, such as dysarthria and apraxia. These\\ncondition affect the muscles used in speaking rather than\\nlanguage function itself. Dysarthria is a speech distur-\\nbance caused by lack of control over the muscles used in\\nspeaking, perhaps due to nerve damage. Speech apraxia is\\na speech disturbance in which language comprehension\\nand muscle control are retained, but the memory of how\\nto use the muscles to form words is not.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAphasia can develop after an individual sustains a\\nbrain injury from a stroke, head trauma, tumor, or infec-\\ntion, such as herpes encephalitis. As a result of this injury,\\nthe pathways for language comprehension or production\\nare disrupted or destroyed. For most people, this means\\ndamage to the left hemisphere of the brain. (In 95 to 99%\\nof right-handed people, language centers are in the left\\nhemisphere, and up to 70% of left-handed people also\\nhave left-hemisphere language dominance.) According to\\nthe traditional classification scheme, each form of aphasia\\nis caused by damage to a different part of the left hemi-\\nsphere of the brain. This damage affects one or more of the\\nbasic language functions: speech, naming (the ability to\\nidentify an object, color, or other item with an appropriate\\nword or term), repetition (the ability to repeat words,\\nphrases, and sentences), hearing comprehension (the abili-\\nty to understand spoken language), reading (the ability to\\nunderstand written words and their meaning), and writing\\n(the ability to communicate and record events with text).\\nThe traditional classification scheme includes eight\\ntypes of aphasia:\\n• Broca’s aphasia, also called motor aphasia, results from\\ndamage to the front portion or frontal lobe of the lan-\\nguage-dominant area of the brain. Individuals with\\nBroca’s aphasia may be completely unable to use speech\\n(mutism) or may be able to use single-word statements\\nor even full sentences, though these sentences may\\nrequire a great deal of effort to construct. Small words,\\nsuch as conjunctions (and, or, but) and articles (the, an,\\na), may be omitted, leading to a “telegraph” quality in\\ntheir speech. Hearing comprehension is usually not\\naffected, so they are able to understand other people’s\\nspeech and conversation and can follow commands.\\nOften, they may experience weakness on the right side of\\ntheir bodies, which can make it difficult to write. Read-\\ning ability is impaired, and they may have difficulty find-\\ning the right word when speaking. Individuals with\\nBroca’s aphasia may become frustrated and depressed\\nbecause they are aware of their language difficulties.\\n• Wernicke’s aphasia is caused by damage to the side\\nportion or temporal lobe of the language-dominant area\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 333\\nAphasia\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 333'),\n",

Individuals with Wernicke’s aphasia speak\\nin long, uninterrupted sentences; however, the words\\nused are frequently unnecessary or even made-up. They\\nhave a great deal of difficulty understanding other peo-\\nple’s speech, sometimes to the point of being unable to\\nunderstand spoken language at all. Reading ability is\\ndiminished, and although writing ability is retained,\\nwhat is written may be abnormal. No physical symp-\\ntoms, such as the right-sided weakness seen with\\nBroca’s aphasia, are typically observed. Also, in con-\\ntrast to Broca’s aphasia, individuals with Wernicke’s\\naphasia are not aware of their language errors.\\n• Global aphasia is caused by widespread damage to the\\nlanguage areas of the left hemisphere. As a result, all\\nbasic language functions are affected, but some areas\\nmay be more affected than others. For example, an indi-\\nvidual may have difficulty speaking but may be able to\\nwrite well. The individual may experience weakness\\nand loss of feeling on the right side of their body.\\n• Conduction aphasia, also called associative aphasia, is\\nrather uncommon. Individuals with conduction aphasia\\nare unable to repeat words, sentences, and phrases.\\nSpeech is fairly unbroken, although individuals may\\nfrequently correct themselves and words may be\\nskipped or repeated. Although able to understand spo-\\nken language, it may also be difficult for the individual\\nwith conduction aphasia to find the right word to\\ndescribe a person or object. The impact of this condi-\\ntion on reading and writing ability varies. As with other\\ntypes of aphasia, right-sided weakness or sensory loss\\nmay be present.\\n• Anomic or nominal aphasia primarily influences an\\nindividual’s ability to find the right name for a person\\nor object. As a result, an object may be described rather\\nthan named. Hearing comprehension, repetition, read-\\ning, and writing are not affected, other than by this\\ninability to find the right name. Speech is fluent, except\\nfor pauses as the individual tries to recall the right\\nname. Physical symptoms are variable, and some indi-\\nviduals have no symptoms of one-sided weakness or\\nsensory loss.\\n• Transcortical aphasia is caused by damage to the lan-\\nguage areas of the left hemisphere outside the primary\\nlanguage areas. There are three types of aphasia:\\ntranscortical motor aphasia, transcortical sensory apha-\\nsia, and mixed transcortical aphasia. All of the transcor-\\ntical aphasias are distinguished from other types by the\\nindividual’s ability to repeat words, phrases, or sen-\\ntences. Other language functions may also be impaired\\nto varying degrees, depending on the extent and partic-\\nular location of brain damage.\\nAs researchers continue to learn more about the\\nbrain’s structure and function, new types of aphasia are\\nbeing recognized. One newly recognized type of aphasia,\\nsubcortical aphasia, mimics the symptoms of other tradi-\\ntional types of aphasia but involves language disorders\\nthat are not typical. This type of aphasia is associated\\nwith injuries to areas of the brain typically not identified\\nwith language and language processing.\\nDiagnosis\\nFollowing brain injury, an initial bedside assessment is\\nmade to determine whether language function has been\\naffected. If the individual experiences difficulty communi-\\ncating, attempts are made to determine whether this diffi-\\nculty arises from impaired language comprehension or an\\nimpaired ability to speak. A typical examination involves\\nlistening to spontaneous speech and evaluating the individ-\\nual’s ability to recognize and name objects, comprehend\\nwhat is heard, and repeat sample words and phrases. The\\nindividual may also be asked to read text aloud and explain\\nwhat the passage means. In addition, writing ability is eval-\\nuated by having the individual copy text, transcribe dictated\\ntext, and write something without prompting.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2334\\nAphasia Broca's area\\nWernicke's area\\nBroca’s aphasia results from damage to the frontal lobe of\\nthe language-dominant area of the brain.

The mature\\nforms of these cells include red blood cells, which carry\\noxygen throughout the body; white blood cells, which\\nfight infection; and platelets, which are involved in clot-\\nting. In aplastic anemia, the basic structure of the marrow\\nbecomes abnormal, and those cells responsible for gener-\\nating blood cells (hematopoietic cells) are greatly\\ndecreased in number or absent. These hematopoietic\\ncells are replaced by large quantities of fat.\\nYearly, aplastic anemia strikes about 5-10 people in\\nevery one million. Although aplastic anemia strikes both\\nmales and females of all ages, there are two age groups\\nthat have an increased risk. Both young adults (between\\n15-30 years of age) and the elderly (over the age of 60)\\nhave higher rates of aplastic anemia than the general\\npopulation. While the disorder occurs worldwide, young\\nadults in Asia have a higher disease rate than do popula-\\ntions in North America and Europe.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAplastic anemia falls into three basic categories,\\nbased on the origin of its cause: idiopathic, acquired, and\\nhereditary.\\nIn about 60% of cases, aplastic anemia is considered\\nto be idiopathic, meaning that the cause of the disorder is\\nunknown.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2336\\nAplastic anemia\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 336'),\n",

The patient is likely to appear pale. If the\\nanemia progresses, decreased oxygen circulating in the\\nblood may lead to an increase in heart rate and the sud-\\nden appearance of a new heart murmur.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe blood count in aplastic anemia will reveal low\\nnumbers of all formed blood cells. Red blood cells will\\nappear normal in size and coloration, but greatly\\ndecreased in number. Cells called reticulocytes (very\\nyoung red blood cells, which are usually produced in\\ngreat numbers by the bone marrow in order to compen-\\nsate for a severe anemia) will be very low in number.\\nPlatelets and white blood cells will also be decreased in\\nnumber, though normal in structure.\\nA sample of the patient’s bone marrow will need to\\nbe removed by needle (usually from the hip bone) and\\nexamined under a microscope. If aplastic anemia is pre-\\nsent, this examination will reveal very few or no\\nhematopoietic cells, and replacement with fat.\\nTreatment\\nThe first step in the treatment of aplastic anemia\\ninvolves discontinuing exposure to any substance that\\nmay be causing the disorder. Although it would seem that\\nblood transfusions would be helpful in this disease, in\\nfact, they only serve as a temporary help, and may com-\\nplicate future attempts at bone marrow transplantation.\\nThe most successful treatment for aplastic anemia is\\nbone marrow transplantation. To do this, a marrow donor\\n(often a sibling) must be identified. There are a number of\\ntissue markers which must be examined to determine\\nwhether a bone marrow donation is likely to be compatible\\nwith the patient’s immune system. Compatibility is neces-\\nsary to avoid complications, including the destruction of\\nthe donor marrow by the patient’s own immune system.\\nPatients who cannot undergo bone marrow trans-\\nplant can be treated with a number of agents, including\\nantithymocyte globulin (ATG), cyclophosphamide,\\nsteroids, and cyclosporine. These agents all have the\\npotential to cause a number of troublesome side-effects.\\nFurthermore, not all patients respond fully to these\\nagents. Still, even among those patients who do have a\\ngood response, many later suffer a relapse (return) of\\naplastic anemia.\\nPrognosis\\nAplastic anemia is a life-threatening illness. Without\\ntreatment, it will almost surely progress to death. Sur-\\nvival depends on how severe the disease is at diagnosis,\\nwhich type of treatment a patient is eligible for, and what\\nkind of response their body has to that treatment. The\\nworst-prognosis type of aplastic anemia is one associated\\nwith very low numbers of a particular type of white\\nblood cell. These patients have a high chance of dying\\nfrom overwhelming bacterial infections. In fact, 80% of\\nall patients treated with blood transfusions alone die\\nwithin 18 months to two years. Patients who undergo\\nbone marrow transplantation have a 60-90% chance of\\nbeing cured of the disease.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nCastro-Malaspina, Hugo, and Richard J.

Therefore, a general surgeon must perform this\\noperation in the operating room of a hospital. An anes-\\nthesiologist is also present during the operation to admin-\\nister an anesthetic.

Occasionally a spinal anesthetic may be used.\\nAfter the patient is anesthetized, the general surgeon\\ncan remove the appendix either by using the traditional\\nopen procedure (in which a 2-3 [5-7.6 cm] in incision is\\nmade in the abdomen) or via laparoscopy (in which four\\n1 in [2.5 cm] incisions are made in the abdomen).\\nTraditional open appendectomy\\nWhen the surgeon uses the open approach, he makes\\nan incision in the lower right section of the abdomen. Most\\nincisions are less than 3 in (7.6 cm) in length. The surgeon\\nthen identifies all of the organs in the abdomen and exam-\\nines them for other disease or abnormalities. The appendix\\nis located and brought up into the wounds. The surgeon\\nseparates the appendix from all the surrounding tissue and\\nits attachment to the cecum and then removes it. The site\\nwhere the appendix was previously attached, the cecum, is\\nclosed and returned to the abdomen. The muscle layers\\nand then the skin are sewn together.\\nLaproscopic appendectomy\\nWhen the surgeon conducts a laproscopic appendec-\\ntomy, four incisions, each about 1 in (2.5 cm) in length,\\nare made. One incision is near the umbilicus, or navel,\\nand one is between the umbilicus and the pubis. Two\\nother incisions are smaller and are in the right side of the\\nlower abdomen. The surgeon then passes a camera and\\nspecial instruments through these incisions. With the aid\\nof this equipment, the surgeon visually examines the\\nabdominal organs and identifies the appendix. Similarly,\\nthe appendix is freed from all of its attachments and\\nremoved. The place where the appendix was formerly\\nattached, the cecum, is stitched. The appendix is\\nremoved through one of the incisions. The instruments\\nare removed and then all of the incisions are closed.\\nStudies and opinions about the relative advantages\\nand disadvantages of each method are divided.

LA is of special benefit in women\\nin whom the diagnosis is difficult and gynecological dis-\\nease (such as endometriosis , pelvic inflammatory dis-\\nease, ruptured ovarian follicles, ruptured ovarian cysts,\\nand tubal pregnancies) may be the source of pain and not\\nappendicitis. If LA is done in these patients, the pelvic\\norgans can be more thoroughly examined and a definitive\\ndiagnosis made prior to removal of the appendix. Most\\nsurgeons select either TA or LA based on the individual\\nneeds and circumstances of the patient.\\nInsurance plans do cover the costs of appendectomy.\\nFees are charged independently by the hospital and the\\nphysicians. Hospital charges include fees for operating\\nand recovery room use, diagnostic and laboratory testing,\\nas well as the normal hospital room charges.

Bleeding can occur\\nbut rarely is a blood transfusion required. Adhesions\\n(abnormal connections to abdominal organs by thin\\nfibrous tissue) is a known complication of any abdominal\\nprocedure such as appendectomy. These adhesions can\\nlead to intestinal obstruction which prevents the normal\\nflow of intestinal contents. Hernia is a complication of\\nany incision, However, they are rarely seen after appen-\\ndectomy because the abdominal wall is very strong in the\\narea of the standard appendectomy incision.\\nThe overall complication rate of appendectomy\\ndepends upon the status of the appendix at the time it is\\nremoved. If the appendix has not ruptured the complication\\nrate is only about 3%. However, if the appendix has rup-\\ntured the complication rate rises to almost 59%. Wound\\ninfections do occur and are more common if the appendici-\\ntis was severe, far advanced, or ruptured.

Treatment of peritonitis as a result of a rup-\\ntured appendix includes removal of what remains of the\\nappendix, insertion of drains (rubber tubes that promote\\nthe flow of infection inside the abdomen to outside of the\\nbody), and antibiotics.

The appendix has no\\nknown function in the body, but it can become diseased.\\nAppendicitis is a medical emergency, and if it is left\\nuntreated the appendix may rupture and cause a poten-\\ntially fatal infection.\\nDescription\\nAppendicitis is the most common abdominal emer-\\ngency found in children and young adults. One person in\\n15 develops appendicitis in his or her lifetime. The inci-\\ndence is highest among males aged 10-14, and among\\nfemales aged 15-19. More males than females develop\\nappendicitis between puberty and age 25. It is rare in the\\nelderly and in children under the age of two.\\nThe hallmark symptom of appendicitis is increasing-\\nly severe abdominal pain. Since many different condi-\\ntions can cause abdominal pain, an accurate diagnosis of\\nappendicitis can be difficult. A timely diagnosis is impor-\\ntant, however, because a delay can result in perforation,\\nor rupture, of the appendix. When this happens, the\\ninfected contents of the appendix spill into the abdomen,\\npotentially causing a serious infection of the abdomen\\ncalled peritonitis.\\nOther conditions can have similar symptoms, espe-\\ncially in women. These include pelvic inflammatory\\ndisease , ruptured ovarian follicles, ruptured ovarian\\ncysts, tubal pregnancies, and endometriosis . Various\\nforms of stomach upset and bowel inflammation may\\nalso mimic appendicitis.\\nThe treatment for acute (sudden, severe) appendici-\\ntis is an appendectomy, surgery to remove the appendix.\\nBecause of the potential for a life-threatening ruptured\\nappendix, persons suspected of having appendicitis are\\noften taken to surgery before the diagnosis is certain.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe causes of appendicitis are not well understood,\\nbut it is believed to occur as a result of one or more of\\nthese factors: an obstruction within the appendix, the\\ndevelopment of an ulceration (an abnormal change in tis-\\nsue accompanied by the death of cells) within the appen-\\ndix, and the invasion of bacteria.\\nUnder these conditions, bacteria may multiply with-\\nin the appendix. The appendix may become swollen and\\nfilled with pus (a fluid formed in infected tissue, consist-\\ning of while blood cells and cellular debris), and may\\neventually rupture. Signs of rupture include the presence\\nof symptoms for more than 24 hours, a fever, a high\\nwhite blood cell count, and a fast heart rate.

The pain, which\\nmay be severe or only achy and uncomfortable, eventual-\\nly moves into the right lower corner of the abdomen.\\nThere, it becomes more steady and more severe, and\\noften increases with movement, coughing, and so forth.\\nThe abdomen often becomes rigid and tender to the\\ntouch. Increasing rigidity and tenderness indicates an\\nincreased likelihood of perforation and peritonitis.\\nLoss of appetite is very common. Nausea and vom-\\niting may occur in about half of the cases and occasion-\\nally there may be constipation or diarrhea. The temper-\\nature may be normal or slightly elevated. The presence of\\na fever may indicate that the appendix has ruptured.\\nDiagnosis\\nA careful examination is the best way to diagnose\\nappendicitis. It is often difficult even for experienced\\nphysicians to distinguish the symptoms of appendicitis\\nfrom those of other abdominal disorders. Therefore, very\\nspecific questioning and a thorough physical examina-\\ntion are crucial. The physician should ask questions,\\nsuch as where the pain is centered, whether the pain has\\nshifted, and where the pain began. The physician should\\npress on the abdomen to judge the location of the pain\\nand the degree of tenderness.\\nThe typical sequence of symptoms is present in about\\n50% of cases. In the other half of cases, less typical pat-\\nterns may be seen, especially in pregnant women, older\\npatients, and infants. In pregnant women, appendicitis is\\neasily masked by the frequent occurrence of mild abdom-\\ninal pain and nausea from other causes. Elderly patients\\nmay feel less pain and tenderness than most patients,\\nthereby delaying diagnosis and treatment, and leading to\\nrupture in 30% of cases. Infants and young children often\\nhave diarrhea, vomiting, and fever in addition to pain.\\nWhile laboratory tests cannot establish the diagno-\\nsis, an increased white cell count may point to appendici-\\ntis. Urinalysis may help to rule out a urinary tract infec-\\ntion that can mimic appendicitis.\\nPatients whose symptoms and physical examination\\nare compatible with a diagnosis of appendicitis are usual-\\nly taken immediately to surgery, where a laparotomy\\n(surgical exploration of the abdomen) is done to confirm\\nthe diagnosis. In cases with a questionable diagnosis,\\nother tests, such as a computed tomography scan (CT)\\nmay be performed to avoid unnecessary surgery. An\\nultrasound examination of the abdomen may help to\\nidentify an inflamed appendix or other condition that\\nwould explain the symptoms. Abdominal x-rays are not\\nof much value except when the appendix has ruptured.\\nOften, the diagnosis is not certain until an operation is\\ndone. To avoid a ruptured appendix, surgery may be recom-\\nmended without delay if the symptoms point clearly to\\nappendicitis. If the symptoms are not clear, surgery may be\\npostponed until they progress enough to confirm a diagnosis.\\nWhen appendicitis is strongly suspected in a woman\\nof child-bearing age, a diagnostic laparoscopy (an\\nexamination of the interior of the abdomen) is sometimes\\nrecommended before the appendectomy in order to be\\nsure that a gynecological problem, such as a ruptured\\novarian cyst, is not causing the pain. In this procedure, a\\nlighted viewing tube is inserted into the abdomen\\nthrough a small incision around the navel.\\nA normal appendix is discovered in about 10-20% of\\npatients who undergo laparotomy, because of suspected\\nappendicitis. Sometimes the surgeon will remove a nor-\\nmal appendix as a safeguard against appendicitis in the\\nfuture. During the surgery, another specific cause for the\\npain and symptoms of appendicitis is found for about\\n30% of these patients.\\nTreatment\\nThe treatment of appendicitis is an immediate\\nappendectomy. This may be done by opening the\\nabdomen in the standard open appendectomy technique,\\nor through laparoscopy. In laparoscopy, a smaller inci-\\nsion is made through the navel. Both methods can suc-\\ncessfully accomplish the removal of the appendix. It is\\nnot certain that laparoscopy holds any advantage over\\nopen appendectomy. When the appendix has ruptured,\\npatients undergoing a laparoscopic appendectomy may\\nhave to be switched to the open appendectomy procedure\\nfor the successful management of the rupture. If a rup-\\ntured appendix is left untreated, the condition is fatal.\\nPrognosis\\nAppendicitis is usually treated successfully by appen-\\ndectomy. Unless there are complications, the patient should\\nrecover without further problems. The mortality rate in\\ncases without complications is less than 0.1%. When an\\nappendix has ruptured, or a severe infection has developed,\\nthe likelihood is higher for complications, with slower\\nrecovery, or death from disease. There are higher rates of\\nperforation and mortality among children and the elderly.\\nPrevention\\nAppendicitis is probably not preventable, although\\nthere is some indication that a diet high in green vegeta-\\nbles and tomatoes may help prevent appendicitis.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2342\\nAppendicitis\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 342'),\n",

It\\nincorporates a system of manual muscle testing and\\ntherapy. AK is based on the theory that an organ dys-\\nfunction is accompanied by a specific muscle weakness.\\nDiseases are diagnosed through muscle-testing proce-\\ndures and then treated. AK is not the same as kinesiolo-\\ngy, or biomechanics, which is the scientific study of\\nmovement.\\nKEY TERMS\\nAppendectomy (or appendicectomy) —Surgical\\nremoval of the appendix.\\nAppendix —The worm-shaped pouch attached to\\nthe cecum, the beginning of the large intestine.\\nLaparotomy —Surgical incision into the loin,\\nbetween the ribs and the pelvis, which offers sur-\\ngeons a view inside the abdominal cavity.\\nPeritonitis —Inflammation of the peritoneum,\\nmembranes lining the abdominal pelvic wall.\\nPurpose\\nAK is not designed for crisis medicine. For example,\\nan AK practitioner cannot cure cancer, arthritis, dia-\\nbetes, heart disease, or infections. This therapy is\\ndesigned to be a part of a holistic approach to preventive\\nmedicine. The goals of AK are to (1) restore normal\\nnerve function, (2) achieve normal endocrine, immune,\\ndigestive, and other internal organ functions, (3) inter-\\nvene early in degenerative processes to prevent or delay\\npathological conditions, and to (4) restore postural bal-\\nance, correct gait (walking) impairment, and improve\\nrange of motion.\\nDescription\\nOrigins\\nAK is based on principles of functional neurology,\\nanatomy, physiology, biomechanics, and biochemistry as\\nwell as principles from Chinese medicine,acupuncture,\\nand massage. It was developed from traditional kinesiolo-\\ngy in 1964 by George G. Goodheart, a chiropractor from\\nDetroit, Michigan. He observed that each large muscle\\nrelates to a body organ. A weakness in a muscle may mean\\nthat there is a problem in the associated organ. Goodheart\\nfound that by treating the muscle and making it strong\\nagain, he was able to improve the function of the organ as\\nwell. For example, if a particular nutritional supplement\\nwas given to a patient, and the muscle tested strong, it was\\nthe correct supplement for the patient. If the muscle\\nremained weak, it was not. Other methods of treatment\\ncan be evaluated in a similar manner. Goodheart also\\nfound that painful nodules (small bumps) may be associat-\\ned with a weak muscle. By deeply massaging the muscle,\\nhe was able to improve its strength. Goodheart’s findings\\nin 1964 led to the origin and insertion treatment, the first\\nmethod developed in AK. Other diagnostic and therapeutic\\nprocedures were developed for various reflexes described\\nby other chiropractors and doctors. Goodheart incorporat-\\ned acupuncture meridian therapy into AK after reading the\\nwritings of Felix Mann, M.D.\\nGoodheart considered AK to be a therapeutic tool\\nthat incorporates feedback from the body. He said that\\n“applied kinesiology is based on the fact that the body\\nlanguage never lies.” He felt that the body’s muscles\\nwere indicators of disharmony. Once muscle weakness\\nhas been ascertained, the problem may be solved in a\\nvariety of ways. If a practitioner approaches the problem\\ncorrectly, he believed, making the proper and adequate\\ndiagnosis and treatment, the outcome is satisfactory both\\nto the doctor and to the patient.\\nAccording to AK, each muscle in the body relates to\\na specific meridian or energy pathway (acupuncture\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 343\\nApplied kinesiology\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 343'),\n",

These meridians also relate to organs\\nor glands, allowing the muscles to provide information\\nabout organ or gland function and energy. The five areas\\nof diagnosis and therapy for the applied kinesiologist are\\n(1) the nervous system, (2) the lymphatic system, (3) the\\nvascular (blood vessel) system, (4) the cerebrospinal sys-\\ntem, and (5) the meridian system.\\nThe first part of AK is muscle testing, which is used\\nto help diagnose what part of the body is functioning\\nabnormally. Muscle testing involves putting the body\\ninto a position that requires a certain muscle to remain\\ncontracted, and then applying pressure against the mus-\\ncle. The testing does not measure strength but is meant to\\nreveal stresses and imbalances in the body through the\\ntension in the muscle. The test evaluates the ability of a\\ncontrolling system (like the nervous system) to adapt the\\nmuscle to meet the changing pressure of the examiner’s\\ntest. AK practitioners also examine structural factors\\nsuch as posture, gait, and range of motion.

He graduated from the National College of\\nChiropractic in 1939 and is recognized as the founder\\nand developer of Applied Kinesiology. After he joined\\nthe U.S. Air Force as an aviation cadet in World War II,\\nhe received a promotion to major at the age of 22. He\\nwas the youngest ever to attain that rank. He served in\\nactive duty from 1941-1946 and continued as a mem-\\nber of the Air Force Reserve until the mid-1950s.\\nDr. Goodheart held numerous positions of distinc-\\ntion during his career, including director of the National\\nChiropractic Mutual Insurance Company and director\\nfor the International College of Applied Kinesiology-\\nU.S.A. He also lectured and taught throughout the Unit-\\ned States, Japan, Europe, and Australia; and he was the\\nofficial doctor of chiropractic for the Lake Placed Winter\\nOlympic Games in 1980. He contributes to a variety of\\ntrade publications on a regular basis.\\nIn 1998 Dr. Goodheart received a Lifetime\\nAchievement Award from the International College of\\nKinesiology. Earlier, in 1987 he was honored with the\\nLeonardo da Vinci Award from the Institute for the\\nAchievement of Human Potential, and he was cited for\\nhis research by Logan and Palmer Colleges of Chiro-\\npractic. He represented the State of Michigan as a dele-\\ngate to the American Chiropractic Association and was\\na fellow at the International College of Chiropractic. He\\nresides with his wife, JoAnn in Grosse Pointe Woods,\\nMichigan, where he enjoys skiing and tennis.\\npractors use AK to help them evaluate the success of\\nspinal adjustment. A leg muscle is tested for strength or\\nweakness to determine whether the adjustments made are\\nappropriate.\\nAccording to AK, common internal causes of mus-\\ncle weakness include:\\n• dysfunction of nerve supply (nerve interference\\nbetween spine and muscles)\\n• impairment of lymphatic drainage\\n• reduction of blood supply\\n• abnormal pressure in cerebral fluid affecting nerve-to-\\nmuscle relationships\\n• blockage of an acupuncture meridian\\n• imbalance of chemicals\\n• dysfunction of organs or glands\\n• excesses or deficiencies in nutrition\\nPhysiological reactions to chemicals, including\\nthose associated with nutrition and allergies, may also be\\nevaluated using AK. The AK protocol for testing chemi-\\ncal compounds is to place the substance on the patient’s\\ntongue so that he tastes the material, and the normal\\nchemical reactions of ingestion begin. In some cases, the\\nsubstances are inhaled through the nose. The AK practi-\\ntioner then tests the associated muscle-organ pattern to\\ndetermine where or if there is a strength or weakness.\\nThe patient does not need to swallow the substance for a\\nchange in strength or weakness to be identified. David S.\\nWalther, a diplomate of the International College of\\nApplied Kinesiology, has indicated that “it is possible\\nthat the central nervous system, recognizing the com-\\npound being ingested, relays information to the organs\\nand glands preparing for use of the compound. If the\\ncompound is recognized as beneficial, the energy pattern\\nis immediately enhanced, influencing not only the organ\\nor gland, but also the associated muscle.”\\nAK has been used as a diagnostic health tool for a\\nvariety of conditions.\\nBone health\\n• neck/low back pain and sciatica\\n• whiplash\\n• frozen shoulder\\nJoint health\\n• carpal tunnel syndrome\\n• arthritis (including rheumatoid arthritis)\\n• sports injuries\\nMuscle health\\n• tennis elbow\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2344\\nApplied kinesiology\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 344'),\n",

Most practi-\\ntioners of AK are chiropractors, but naturopaths, medical\\ndoctors, dentists, osteopaths, nutritionists, physical thera-\\npists, massage therapists, podiatrists, psychiatrists, and\\nnurse practitioners are also involved. In 1991, 37.2% of\\n4,835 full-time chiropractors in the United States who\\nresponded to a survey by the National Board of Chiro-\\npractic Examiners (NBCE) said they used AK in their\\npractice. Subsequent NBCE surveys indicated that 31%\\nof chiropractors in Canada, 60% in Australia, and 72% in\\nNew Zealand use AK.\\nMost practitioners of AK utilize a holistic approach\\nand evaluate a person from a triad-based health perspec-\\ntive. Generally, chiropractors approach health and heal-\\ning from a structural basis, medical doctors generally\\nfrom a chemical basis, and psychiatrists and psycholo-\\ngists from a mental or emotional basis. Applied kinesiol-\\nogists attempt to work with all three areas of health, and\\nin some cases, include a spiritual dimension.\\nThe use of AK is often included in insurance cover-\\nage if the policy covers chiropractor benefits. The cost of\\nthe AK examination is similar to the costs of other chiro-\\npractic practices.\\nPrecautions\\nAK should only by used by trained professionals\\nwith the necessary expertise to perform specific and\\naccurate tests. The AK examination should be combined\\nwith a standard physical diagnosis, which often includes\\nlaboratory tests, x rays, health and dietary history, and\\nother special tests. An AK examination should enhance a\\nstandard diagnosis, not replace it. The total diagnostic\\nwork-up should be used to determine the final diagnosis.\\nThe use of manual muscle testing to evaluate nutri-\\ntion is particularly a problem if it is done by a lay nutri-\\ntion sales person as a tool to sell his/her product. The per-\\nson should have the educational background to evaluate\\nnutritional needs as well as have a high level of knowl-\\nedge in the use of proper muscle testing techniques.\\nSide effects\\nIf AK is performed by a trained practitioner with the\\nappropriate educational background, side effects from\\nthe muscle-testing procedures should be minimal.\\nResearch and general acceptance\\nAK is a tool that is used by many health care pro-\\nfessionals, and especially by chiropractors. A literature\\nreview published in 1999 by researchers from the\\nSchool of Medicine at the University of North Carolina\\nat Chapel Hill and the Foundation for Allied Conserva-\\ntive Therapies Research in Chapel Hill stated that,\\nalthough AK appears to be a promising methodology,\\nthere is a lack of research results relevant to clinical\\npractice and outcomes of AK care. They found this\\nlack of results surprising, since cost, satisfaction, uti-\\nlization, and changes in symptoms are the important\\nresults of clinical practice. In addition, they determined\\nthat some studies that were supposed to be an evalua-\\ntion of AK procedures did not actually use clinical\\npractices and principles of AK. However, from studies\\nadhering to AK principles and employing standardized\\ntraining by well-trained practitioners, they did state\\nthere was some evidence that AK is an objectively veri-\\nfiable phenomenon.

The term arbovirus stands for Arthro-\\npod-borne virus because these viruses are passed to\\nhumans by members of the phylum Arthropoda (which\\nincludes insects and spiders).\\nDescription\\nOf the huge number of arboviruses known to exist,\\nabout 80 types are responsible for human disease. In\\naddition to the virus, there are usually two other types of\\nliving creatures involved in the cycle leading to human\\ndisease. When large quantities of virus are present in an\\narthropod (often a tick or mosquito), the viruses are\\npassed to a bird or small mammal when the arthropod\\nattempts to feed on the blood of that creature. The virus\\nthrives within the new host, sometimes causing illness,\\nsometimes not. More ticks or mosquitoes are infected\\nwith the virus when they feed on the host’s blood. Even-\\ntually, a tick or mosquito bites a human, and the virus is\\npassed along. Just a few types of arboviruses cycle only\\nbetween arthropods and humans, with no intermediate\\nstop in a bird or small mammal.\\nBecause the arboviruses require an arthropod to pass\\nthem along to humans, the most common times of year\\nfor these illnesses include summer and fall, when mos-\\nquitoes and ticks are most prevalent. Damp environments\\nfavor large populations of mosquitoes, and thus also\\nincrease the risk of arbovirus infections.\\nThe major causes of arbovirus encephalitis include\\nthe members of the viral families alphavirus (causing\\nEastern equine encephalitis, Western equine encephalitis,\\nand Venezuelan equine encephalitis), flavivirus (respon-\\nsible for St. Louis encephalitis,Japanese encephalitis ,\\nTick-borne encephalitis, Murray Valley encephalitis,\\nRussian spring-summer encephalitis, and Powassan), and\\nbunyavirus (causing California encephalitis).\\nIn the United States, the most important types of\\narbovirus encephalitis include Western equine encephali-\\ntis (WEE), Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), St. Louis\\nencephalitis, and California encephalitis. WEE strikes\\nyoung infants in particular, with a 5% chance of death\\nfrom the illness. Of those who survive, about 60% suffer\\npermanent brain damage. EEE strikes infants and chil-\\ndren, with a 20% chance of death, and a high rate of per-\\nmanent brain damage among survivors. St. Louis\\nencephalitis tends to strike adults older than 40 years of\\nage, and older patients tend to have higher rates of death\\nand long-term disability from the infection. California\\nvirus primarily strikes 5-18 year olds, with a lower\\ndegree of permanent brain damage.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nEncephalitis occurs because specific arboviruses\\nhave biochemical characteristics which cause them to be\\nparticularly attracted to the cells of the brain and the\\nnerves. The virus causes cell death and inflammation,\\nwith fever and swelling within the brain and nerves. The\\nmembranous coverings of the brain and spinal cord (the\\nmeninges) may also become inflamed, a condition called\\nmeningitis. The brain is swollen, and patches of bleed-\\ning occur throughout the brain and spinal cord.\\nPatients with encephalitis suffer from headaches,\\nfever, nausea and vomiting , stiff neck, and sleepiness.\\nAs the disease progresses, more severe symptoms devel-\\nop, including tremors, confusion, seizures, coma, and\\nparalysis . Loss of function occurs when specific nerve\\nareas are damaged and/or killed.\\nDiagnosis\\nEarly in the disease, laboratory testing of blood may\\nreveal the presence of the arbovirus. The usual technique\\nused to verify the presence of arbovirus involves injecting\\nthe patient’s blood into the brain of a newborn mouse,\\nthen waiting to see if the mouse develops encephalitis.\\nDiagnosis is usually based on the patient’s symptoms,\\nhistory of tick or mosquito bites, and knowledge that the\\npatient has been in an area known to harbor the arbovirus.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment is mostly supportive, meaning it is direct-\\ned at improving the symptoms, but does not shorten the\\ncourse of the illness. The main concerns of treatment\\ninvolve lowering fever, treating pain, avoiding dehydra-\\ntion or other chemical imbalances, and decreasing\\nswelling in the brain with steroids.\\nPrognosis\\nPrognosis depends on the particular type of\\narbovirus causing disease, and on the age and prior\\nhealth status of the patient. Death rates range all the way\\nup to 20% for arbovirus encephalitis, and the rates of\\nlifelong effects due to brain damage reach 60% for some\\ntypes of arboviruses.\\nPrevention\\nPrevention involves avoiding contact with arthro-\\npods which carry these viruses.

As early as\\n1500 B.C. the ancient Egyptians used waters, oils,\\nincense, resins, and ointments scented with botanicals for\\ntheir religious ceremonies.\\nThere is evidence that the Chinese may have recog-\\nnized the benefits of herbal and aromatic remedies much\\nearlier than this. The oldest known herbal text, Shen\\nNung’s Pen Ts’ao(c. 2700-3000 B.C.) catalogs over 200\\nbotanicals. Ayurveda, a practice of traditional Indian\\nmedicine that dates back over 2,500 years, also used aro-\\nmatic herbs for treatment.\\nThe Romans were well-known for their use of fra-\\ngrances. They bathed with botanicals and integrated\\nthem into their state and religious rituals. So did the\\nGreeks, with a growing awareness of the medicinal prop-\\nerties of herbs, as well. Greek physician and surgeon\\nPedanios Dioscorides, whose renown herbal text De\\nMateria Medica (60 A.D.) was the standard textbook for\\nWestern medicine for 1,500 years, wrote extensively on\\nthe medicinal value of botanical aromatics. The Medica\\ncontained detailed information on over 500 plants and\\n4,740 separate medicinal uses for them, including an\\nentire section on aromatics.\\nWritten records of herbal distillation are found as early\\nas the first century A.D., and around 1000 A.D., the noted\\nArab physician and naturalist Avicenna described the distil-\\nlation of rose oil from rose petals, and the medicinal prop-\\nerties of essential oils in his writings. However, it wasn’t\\nuntil 1937, when French chemist René-Maurice Gattefossé\\npublished Aromatherapie: Les Huiles essentielles, hor-\\nmones végé tales, that aromatherapie, or aromatherapy, was\\nintroduced in Europe as a medical discipline. Gattefossé,\\nwho was employed by a French perfumeur, discovered the\\nhealing properties of lavender oil quite by accident when\\nhe suffered a severe burn while working and used the clos-\\nest available liquid, lavender oil, to soak it in.\\nIn the late 20th century, French physician Jean Valnet\\nused botanical aromatics as a front line treatment for\\nwounded soldiers in World War II.

As essential oils are\\nabsorbed into the bloodstream through application to the\\nskin or inhalation, their active components trigger certain\\npharmalogical effects (e.g., pain relief).\\nIn addition to physical benefits, aromatherapy has\\nstrong psychological benefits. The volatility of an oil, or\\nthe speed at which it evaporates in open air, is thought to\\nbe linked to the specific psychological effect of an oil. As\\na rule of thumb, oils that evaporate quickly are consid-\\nered emotionally uplifting, while slowly-evaporating oils\\nare thought to have a calming effect.\\nEssential oils commonly used in aromatherapy treat-\\nment include:\\n• Roman chamomile ( Chamaemelum nobilis ). An anti-\\ninflammatory and analgesic. Useful in treating otitis\\nmedia (earache), skin conditions, menstrual pains, and\\ndepression.\\n• Clary sage (Salvia sclarea ). This natural astringent is\\nnot only used to treat oily hair and skin, but is also said\\nto be useful in regulating the menstrual cycle, improv-\\ning mood, and controlling high blood pressure. Clary\\nsage should not be used by pregnant women.\\n• Lavender (Lavandula officinalis).

Myrtle is a fungicide, dis-\\ninfectant, and antibacterial. It is often used in steam\\naromatherapy treatments to alleviate the symptoms of\\nwhooping cough, bronchitis , and other respiratory\\ninfections.\\n• Neroli (bitter orange), ( Citrus aurantium ). Citrus oil\\nextracted from bitter orange flower and peel and used to\\ntreat sore throat , insomnia, and stress and anxiety-\\nrelated conditions.\\n• Sweet orange (Citrus sinensis). An essential oil used to\\ntreat stomach complaints and known for its reported\\nability to lift the mood while relieving stress.\\n• Peppermint (Mentha piperita). Relaxes and soothes the\\nstomach muscles and gastrointestinal tract. Pepper-\\nmint’s actions as an anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, and\\nantimicrobial also make it an effective skin treatment,\\nand useful in fighting cold and flu symptoms.\\n• Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis). Stimulating essen-\\ntial oil used to treat muscular and rheumatic com-\\nplaints, as well as low blood pressure, gastrointestinal\\nproblems, and headaches.\\n• Tea tree ( Melaleuca alternifolia ).

The heartbeat can be too slow, too fast,\\nhave extra beats, skip a beat, or otherwise beat irregularly.\\nDescription\\nArrhythmias are deviations from the normal cadence\\nof the heartbeat, which cause the heart to pump improp-\\nerly. The normal heartbeat starts in the right atrium,\\nwhere the heart’s natural pacemaker (the sinus node)\\nsends an electrical signal to the center of the heart to the\\natrioventricular node. The atrioventricular node then\\nsends signals into the main pumping chamber to make\\nthe ventricle contract. Arrhythmias occur when the heart-\\nbeat starts in a part of the heart other than the sinus node,\\nan abnormal rate or rhythm develops in the sinus node, or\\na heart conduction “block” prevents the electrical signal\\nfrom traveling down the normal pathway.\\nMore than four million Americans have arrhythmias,\\nmost of which are harmless. Middle-aged adults common-\\nly experience arrhythmias. As people age, the probability\\nof experiencing an arrhythmia increases. Arrhythmias\\noften occur in people who do not have heart disease. In\\npeople with heart disease, it is usually the heart disease\\nwhich is dangerous, not the arrhythmia. Arrhythmias often\\noccur during and after heart attacks. Some types of\\narrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia, are serious\\nand even life threatening. In the United States, arrhythmias\\nare the primary cause of sudden cardiac death, account-\\ning for more than 350,000 deaths each year.\\nSlow heart rates (less than 60 beats per minute) are\\ncalled bradycardias, while fast heart rates (more than 100\\nbeats per minute) are called tachycardias. Bradycardia\\ncan result in poor circulation of blood, and, hence, a lack\\nof oxygen throughout the body, especially the brain.\\nTachycardias also can compromise the heart’s ability to\\npump effectively because the ventricles do not have\\nenough time to completely fill.\\nArrhythmias are characterized by their site of origin:\\nthe atria or the ventricles. Supraventricular arrhythmias\\noccur in the upper areas of the heart and are less serious\\nthan ventricular arrhythmias. Ventricular fibrillation is\\nthe most serious arrhythmia and is fatal unless medical\\nhelp is immediate.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nIn many cases, the cause of an arrhythmia is\\nunknown.

Sometimes arrhythmias can be identified by\\nlistening to the patient’s heart through a stethoscope, but,\\nsince arrhythmias are not always present, they may not\\noccur during the physical exam.\\nAn electrocardiogram (ECG) shows the heart’s\\nactivity and may reveal a lack of oxygen from poor circu-\\nlation (ischemia ). Electrodes covered with conducting\\njelly are placed on the patient’s chest, arms, and legs.\\nThey send impulses of the heart’s activity through an\\nelectrical activity monitor (oscilloscope) to a recorder\\nthat traces them on paper. The test takes about 10 min-\\nutes and is performed in a physician’s office. Another\\ntype of ECG, commonly known as the exercisestress\\ntest, measures how the heart and blood vessels respond\\nto exertion while the patient is exercising on a treadmill\\nor a stationary bike. This test is performed in a physi-\\ncian’s office or an exercise laboratory and takes 15-30\\nminutes. Other types of ECGs include 24-hour ECG\\nmonitoring and transtelephonic monitoring. In 24-hour\\nECG (Holter) monitoring, the patient wears a small,\\nportable tape recorder connected to disks on his/her chest\\nthat record the heart’s rhythm during daily activities.\\nTranstelephonic monitoring can identify arrhythmias that\\noccur infrequently. Similar to Holter monitoring ,\\ntranstelephonic monitoring can continue for days or\\nweeks, and it enables patients to send the ECG via tele-\\nphone to a monitoring station when an arrhythmia is felt,\\nor the patient can store the information in the recorder\\nand transmit it later.\\nElectrophysiologic studies are invasive procedures\\nperformed in a hospital to identify the origin of serious\\narrhythmias and responses to various treatments. They\\ninvolve cardiac catheterization , in which catheters\\ntipped with electrodes are passed from a vein in the arm\\nor leg through the blood vessels into the heart. The elec-\\ntrodes record impulses in the heart, highlighting where\\nthe arrhythmia starts. During the procedure, physicians\\ncan test the effects of various drugs by provoking an\\narrhythmia through the electrodes and trying different\\ndrugs. The procedure takes one to three hours, during\\nwhich the patient is awake but mildly sedated. Local\\nanesthetic is injected at the catheter insertion sites.\\nTreatment\\nMany arrhythmias do not require any treatment. For\\nserious arrhythmias, treating the underlying heart disease\\nsometimes controls the arrhythmia. In some cases, the\\narrhythmia itself is treated with drugs, electrical shock (car-\\ndioversion), automatic implantable defibrillators, artificial\\npacemakers, catheter ablation, or surgery. Supraventricu-\\nlar arrhythmias often can be treated with drug therapy. Ven-\\ntricular arrhythmias are more complex to treat.\\nDrug therapy can manage many arrhythmias, but\\nfinding the right drug and dose requires care and can take\\nsome time. Common drugs for suppressing arrhythmias\\ninclude beta-blockers,calcium channel blockers, quini-\\ndine, digitalis preparations, and procainamide. Because\\nof their potential serious side effects, stronger, desensi-\\ntizing drugs are used only to treat life-threatening\\narrhythmias. All of the drugs used to treat arrhythmias\\nhave possible side effects, ranging from mild complica-\\ntions with beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers to\\nmore serious effects of desensitizing drugs that can, para-\\ndoxically, cause arrhythmias or make them worse.\\nResponse to drugs is usually measured by ECG, Holter\\nmonitor, or electrophysiologic study.\\nIn emergency situations, cardioversion or defibrilla-\\ntion (the application of an electrical shock to the chest\\nwall) is used. Cardioversion restores the heart to its nor-\\nmal rhythm. It is followed by drug therapy to prevent\\nrecurrence of the arrhythmia.\\nArtificial pacemakers that send electrical signals to\\nmake the heart beat properly can be implanted under the\\nskin during a simple operation. Leads from the pacemak-\\ner are anchored to the right side of the heart. Pacemakers\\nare used to correct bradycardia and are sometimes used\\nafter surgical or catheter ablation.\\nAutomatic implantable defibrillators correct life-\\nthreatening ventricular arrhythmias by recognizing them\\nand then restoring a normal heart rhythm by pacing the\\nheart or giving it an electric shock. They are implanted\\nwithin the chest wall without major surgery and store\\ninformation for future evaluation by physicians. Auto-\\nmatic implantable defibrillators have proven to be more\\neffective in saving lives than drugs alone. They often are\\nused in conjunction with drug therapy.\\nAblation, a procedure to alter or remove the heart\\ntissue causing the arrhythmia in order to prevent a recur-\\nrence, can be performed through a catheter or surgery.\\nSupraventricular tachycardia can be treated successfully\\nwith ablation. Catheter ablation is performed in a\\ncatheterization laboratory with the patient under seda-\\ntion.

High-frequency radio waves are\\nthen used to remove the pathway(s) causing the arrhyth-\\nmia. Surgical ablation is similar in principle but it is per-\\nformed in a hospital, using a cold probe instead of radio\\nwaves to destroy tissue.

This is often recommended\\nfor patients who have not responded to drugs or car-\\ndioversion.\\nAlternative treatment\\nSince some arrhythmias can be life threatening, a\\nconventional medical doctor should always be consulted\\nfirst. Acupuncture can correct an insignificant number\\n(1.5%) of atrial fibrillation cases. For new, minor arrhyth-\\nmias, acupuncture may be effective in up to 70% of cases,\\nbut this figure may not differ much from placebo therapy.\\nBoth western and Chinese herbal remedies are also used\\nin the treatment of arrhythmias. Since hawthorn (Cratae-\\ngus laevigata) dilates the blood vessels and stimulates the\\nheart muscle, it may help to stabilize arrhythmias. It is\\ngentle and appropriate for home use, unlike foxglove\\n(Digitalis purpurea), an herb whose action on the heart is\\ntoo potent for use without supervision by a qualified prac-\\ntitioner. Homeopathic practitioners may prescribe reme-\\ndies such as Lachesis and aconite or monkshood (Aconi-\\ntum napellus) to treat mild arrhythmias.\\nPrognosis\\nAdvances in diagnostic techniques, new drugs, and\\nmedical technology have extended the lives of many\\npatients with serious arrhythmias.

If all or part of the\\nblockage breaks away and lodges in another part of the\\nartery, it is called an embolism. Blockage of an artery in\\nthis manner can be the result of a blood clot, fat cells, or\\nan air bubble.\\nWhen an embolus blocks the flow of blood in an\\nartery, the tissues beyond the plug are deprived of normal\\nblood flow and oxygen. This can cause severe damage\\nand even death of the tissues involved.\\nEmboli can affect any part of the body. The most\\ncommon sites are the legs and feet. When the brain is\\naffected, it is called a stroke. When the heart is involved,\\nit is called a heart attack or myocardial infarction (MI).\\nCauses and symptoms\\nA common cause of embolus is when an artery\\nwhose lining has become thickened or damaged, usually\\nwith age, allows cholesterol to build up more easily than\\nnormal on the artery wall. If some of the cholesterol\\nbreaks off, it forms an embolus. Emboli also commonly\\nform from blood clots in a heart that has been damaged\\nfrom heart attack or when the heart contracts abnormally\\nfrom arterial fibrillation.\\nOther known causes are fat cells that enter the blood\\nafter a major bone fracture, infected blood cells, cancer\\ncells that enter the blood stream, and small gas bubbles.\\nSymptoms of an embolus can begin suddenly or build\\nslowly over time, depending on the amount of blocked\\nblood flow.\\nIf the embolus is in an arm or leg, there will be mus-\\ncle pain, numbness or tingling, pale skin color, lower\\ntemperature in the limb, and weakness or loss of muscle\\nfunction. If it occurs in an internal organ, there is usually\\npain and/or loss of the organ’s function.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe following tests can be used to confirm the pres-\\nence of an arterial embolism:\\n• Electrocardiogram, also known as an EKG or ECG. For\\nthis test, patches that detect electrical impulses from the\\nheart are attached to the chest and extremities. The infor-\\nmation is displayed on a monitor screen or a paper tape\\nin the form of waves.

In this procedure, a colored liquid mate-\\nrial (a dye, or contrast material) that can be seen with x\\nrays is injected into the blood stream through a small\\ntube called a catheter. As the dye fills the arteries, they\\nare easily seen on x ray motion pictures. If there is a\\nblockage in the artery, it shows up as a sudden cut off in\\nthe movement of contrast material. Angiography is an\\nexpensive procedure and does carry some risk. The\\ncatheter may cause a blood clot to form, blocking blood\\nflow. There is also the risk of poking the catheter\\nthrough the artery or heart muscle. Some people may\\nbe allergic to the dye.

Normally, oxygenated blood flows to\\nthe tissue through arteries and capillaries. Following the\\nrelease of oxygen in the tissues, the blood returns to the\\nheart in veins. An arteriovenous fistula is an abnormal con-\\nnection of an artery and a vein. The blood bypasses the cap-\\nillaries and tissues, and returns to the heart. Arterial blood\\nhas a higher blood pressure than veins and causes swelling\\nof veins involved in a fistula. Although both the artery and\\nthe vein retain their normal connections, the new opening\\nbetween the two will cause some arterial blood to shunt\\ninto the vein because of the blood pressure difference.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThere are two types of arteriovenous fistulas, congen-\\nital and acquired. A congenital arteriovenous fistula is one\\nthat formed during fetal development. It is a birth defect.\\nKEY TERMS\\nCongenital—Present at the time of birth.\\nIn congenital fistulas, blood vessels of the lower extremity\\nare more frequently involved than other areas of the body.\\nCongenital fistulas are not common. An acquired arteri-\\novenous fistula is one that develops after a person is born.\\nIt usually occurs when an artery and vein that are side-by-\\nside are damaged and the healing process results in the\\ntwo becoming linked. After catheterizations, arteriovenous\\nfistulas may occur as a complication of the arterial punc-\\nture in the leg or arm. Fistulas also form without apparent\\ncause. In the case of patients on hemodialysis, physicians\\nperform surgery to create a fistula. These patients receive\\nmany needle sticks to flush their blood through dialysis\\nmachines and for routine blood analysis testing. The veins\\nused may scar and become difficult to use. Surgery is used\\nto connect an artery and vein so that arterial blood pressure\\nand flow rate widens the vein and decreases the chance of\\nblood clots forming inside the vein.\\nThe main symptoms of arteriovenous fistulas near\\nthe surface of the skin are bulging and discolored veins.\\nIn some cases, the bulging veins can be mistaken for\\nvaricose veins. Other fistulas can cause more serious\\nproblems depending on their location and the blood ves-\\nsels involved.\\nDiagnosis\\nUsing a stethoscope, a physician can detect the\\nsound of a pulse in the affected vein (bruit). The sound is\\na distinctive to-and-fro sound. Dye into the blood can be\\ntracked by x ray to confirm the presence of a fistula.\\nTreatment\\nSmall arteriovenous fistulas can be corrected by\\nsurgery. Fistulas in the brain or eye are very difficult to\\ntreat. If surgery is not possible or very difficult, injection\\ntherapy may be used. Injection therapy is the injection of\\nsubstances that cause the blood to clot at the site of the\\ninjection. In the case of an arteriovenous fistula, the\\nblood clot should stop the passage of blood from the\\nartery to the vein. Surgery is usually used to correct\\nacquired fistulas once they are diagnosed.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nAlexander, R. W., R. C. Schlant, and V . Fuster, eds. The Heart.\\n9th ed.

Lohr, PhD\\nArteriovenous malformations\\nDefinition\\nArteriovenous malformations are blood vessel\\ndefects that occur before birth when the fetus is growing\\nin the uterus (prenatal development). The blood vessels\\nappear as a tangled mass of arteries and veins. They do\\nnot possess the capillary (very fine blood vessels) bed\\nwhich normally exists in the common area where the\\narteries and veins lie in close proximity (artery-vein\\ninterface). An arteriovenous malformation (A VM) may\\nhemorrhage, or bleed, leading to serious complications\\nthat can be life-threatening.\\nDescription\\nA VMs represent an abnormal interface between\\narteries and veins. Normally, arteries carry oxygenated\\nblood to the body’s tissues through progressively smaller\\nblood vessels. The smallest are capillaries, which form a\\nweb of blood vessels (the capillary bed) through the\\nbody’s tissues. The arterial blood moves through tissues\\nby these tiny pathways, exchanging its load of oxygen\\nand nutrients for carbon dioxide and other waste products\\nproduced by the body cells (cellular wastes). The blood is\\ncarried away by progressively larger blood vessels, the\\nveins. A VMs lack a capillary bed and arterial blood is\\nmoved (shunted) directly from the arteries into the veins.\\nA VMs can occur anywhere in the body and have been\\nfound in the arms, hands, legs, feet, lungs, heart, liver, and\\nkidneys. However, 50% of these malformations are locat-\\ned in the brain, brainstem, and spinal cord. Owing to the\\npossibility of hemorrhaging, such A VMs carry the risk of\\nstroke, paralysis, and the loss of speech, memory, or\\nvision. An A VM that hemorrhages can be fatal.\\nApproximately three of every 100,000 people have a\\ncerebral A VM and roughly 40-80% of them will experi-\\nence some bleeding from the abnormal blood vessels at\\nsome point. The annual risk of an A VM bleeding is esti-\\nmated at about 1-4%. After age 55, the risk of bleeding\\ndecreases. Pre-existing high blood pressure or intense\\nphysical activity do not seem to be associated with A VM\\nhemorrhage, but pregnancy and labor could cause a rup-\\nture or breaking open of a blood vessel. An A VM hemor-\\nrhage is not as dangerous as an aneurysmal rupture. (An\\naneurysm is a swollen, blood filled vessel where the\\npressure of the blood causes the wall to bulge outward.)\\nThere is an approximate 10% fatality rate associated with\\nA VM hemorrhage, compared to a 50% fatality rate for\\nruptured aneurysms.\\nAlthough A VMs are congenital defects, meaning a\\nperson is born with them, they are rarely discovered\\nbefore age 20. A genetic link has been proposed for some\\nA VMs, but studies are only suggestive, not positive. The\\nmajority of A VMs are discovered in people age 20-40.\\nMedical researchers estimate that the malformations are\\ncreated during days 45-60 of fetal development. A sec-\\nond theory suggests that A VMs are primitive structures\\nthat are left over from the period when fetal blood circu-\\nlating systems began to develop.\\nHowever they form, A VMs have blood vessels that\\nare abnormally fragile. The arteries that feed into the\\nmalformation are unusually swollen and thin walled.\\nThey lack the usual amount of smooth muscle tissue and\\nelastin, a fibrous connective tissue. These blood vessels\\ncommonly accumulate deposits of calcium salts and\\nhyalin. The venous part of the malformation receives\\nblood directly from the artery. Without the intervening\\ncapillary bed, the veins receive blood at a higher pressure\\nthan they were designed to handle. This part of the mal-\\nformation is also swollen (dilated) and thin walled. There\\nis a measurable risk of an aneurysm forming near an\\nA VM, increasing the threat of hemorrhage, brain dam-\\nage, and death. Approximately 10-15% of A VMs are\\naccompanied by saccular aneurysms, a type of aneurysm\\nthat looks like a small sac attached to the outer wall of\\nthe blood vessel.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 357\\nArteriovenous malformations\\nArteriovenous malformations.

These blood vessels feed into the mal-\\nformation, causing it to grow larger in some cases. As the\\nA VM receives more blood through this “steal,” adjacent\\nbrain tissue does not receive enough. These areas show\\nabnormal nerve cell growth, cell death, and deposits of\\ncalcium in that area (calcification). Nerve cells within the\\nmalformation may demonstrate abnormal growth and are\\nbelieved to be nonfunctional.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nMost people do not realize that they have an A VM\\nunless it hemorrhages enough to produce symptoms.\\nSmall A VMs are more likely to hemorrhage. If a hemor-\\nrhage occurs, it produces a sudden, severe headache .\\nThe headache may be focused in one specific area or it\\nmay be more general. It can be mistaken for a migraine\\nin some cases. The headache is accompanied by other\\nsymptoms, such as vomiting, a stiff neck, sleepiness,\\nlethargy, confusion, irritability, or weakness anywhere in\\nthe body. Seizures occur in about a quarter of A VM\\ncases. A person may experience decreased, double, or\\nblurred vision. Hemorrhaging from an A VM is generally\\nless dangerous than hemorrhaging from an aneurysm,\\nwith a survival rate of 80-90%.\\nOther symptoms occur less frequently, but some-\\ntimes appear alongside major symptoms such as the sud-\\nden severe headache. Additional warning signs of a\\nbleeding A VM are impaired speech or smell,fainting ,\\nfacial paralysis, a drooping eyelid, dizziness, and ringing\\nor buzzing in the ears.\\nAlthough large A VMs are less likely to hemorrhage,\\nthey can induce symptoms based on their mass alone.\\nLarge A VMs exert pressure against brain tissue, cause\\nabnormal development in the surrounding brain tissue,\\nand slow down or block blood flow. Hydrocephalus ,a\\nswelling of brain tissue caused by accumulated fluids,\\nmay develop. The warning signs associated with a large\\nnon-bleeding A VM are similar to the symptoms of a\\nsmall malformation that is bleeding. Unexplained\\nheadaches, seizures, dizziness, and neurological symp-\\ntoms, such as sensory changes, are signals that demand\\nmedical attention.\\nDiagnosis\\nBased on the clinical symptoms such as severe\\nheadache and neurological problems, and after a com-\\nplete neurologic exam , a computed tomography scan\\n(CT) of the head will be done. In some cases, a whoosh-\\ning sound from arteries in the neck or over the eye or jaw\\n(called a bruit), can be heard with a stethoscope. The CT\\nscan will reveal whether there has been bleeding in the\\nbrain and can identify A VMs larger than 1 inch (2.5 cm).\\nMagnetic resonance imaging(MRI) is also used to\\nidentify an A VM. A lumbar puncture, or spinal tap, may\\nfollow the MRI or CT scan. A lumbar puncture involves\\nremoving a small amount of cerebrospinal fluid from the\\nlower part of the spine. Blood cells or blood breakdown\\nproducts in the cerebrospinal fluid indicate bleeding.\\nTo pinpoint where the blood is coming from, a cere-\\nbral angiography is done. This procedure uses x rays to\\nmap out the blood vessels in the brain, including the ves-\\nsels that feed into the malformation. The information\\ngained from angiography complements the MRI and\\nhelps distinguish the precise location of the A VM.\\nTreatment\\nNeurosurgeons consider several factors before\\ndeciding on a treatment option. There is some debate\\nover whether or not to treat A VMs that have not rup-\\ntured and are not causing any symptoms. The risks and\\nbenefits of proceeding with treatment need to be mea-\\nsured on an individual basis, taking into account factors\\nsuch as the person’s age and general health, as well as\\nthe A VM’s size and location. Several treatment options\\nare available, both for symptomatic or asymptomatic\\nA VMs. These treatment options may be used alone or in\\ncombination.\\nSurgery\\nRemoving the A VM is the surest way of preventing\\nit from causing future problems. Both small and large\\nA VMs can be handled in surgery. Surgery is recommend-\\ned for superficial A VMs, but may be too dangerous for\\ndeep or very large A VMs. Unless it is an emergency situ-\\nation, an A VM that has hemorrhaged is treated conserva-\\ntively for several weeks. Conservative treatment consists\\nof managing the immediate symptoms and allowing the\\npatient’s condition to stabilize. Surgery requires general\\nanesthesia and a longer period of recuperation than any\\nother treatment option.\\nRadiation\\nRadiation is particularly useful to treat small (under\\n1 in) malformations that are deep within the brain. Ioniz-\\ning radiation is directed at the malformation, destroying\\nthe A VM without damaging the surrounding tissue. Radi-\\nation treatment is accomplished in a single session and it\\nis not necessary to open the skull. However, success can\\nonly be measured over the course of the following two\\nyears. A year after the procedure, 50-75% of treated\\nA VMs are completely blocked; two years after radiation\\ntreatment, the percentage increases to 85-95%.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2358\\nArteriovenous malformations\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 358'),\n",

Next, if fluids are pre-\\nsent in the joint, the physician may suction them out (aspi-\\nrate) with a needle. These fluids may be sent to a laborato-\\nry for further study. Contrast agents are then injected into\\nthe joint through the same location by attaching the aspi-\\nrating needle to a syringe containing the contrast medium.\\nThe purpose of contrast agents in x-ray procedures is to\\nhelp highlight details of areas under study by making them\\nopaque. Agents for arthrography are generally air and\\nwater-soluble dyes, the most common containing iodine.\\nAir and iodine may be used together or independently.\\nAfter the contrast agent is administered, the site of injec-\\ntion will be sealed and the patient may be asked to move\\nthe joint around to distribute the contrast.\\nBefore the contrast medium can be absorbed by the\\njoint itself, several films will be quickly taken under the\\nguidance of the fluoroscope. The patient will be asked to\\nmove the joint into a series of positions, keeping still\\nbetween positioning. Sometimes, the patient will experience\\nsome tingling or discomfort during the procedure, which is\\nnormal and due to the contrast. Following fluoroscopic\\ntracking of the contrast, standard x rays of the area may also\\nbe taken. The entire procedure will last about one hour.\\nPreparation\\nIt is important to discuss any known sensitivity to\\nlocal anesthetics or iodine prior to this procedure. A\\nphysician should explain the procedure and the risks\\nassociated with contrast agents and ask the patient to sign\\nan informed consent. If iodine contrast will be adminis-\\ntered, the patient may be instructed not to eat before the\\nexam. The timeframe of fasting may extend from only\\n90 minutes prior to the exam up to the night before.\\nThere is no other preparation necessary.\\nAftercare\\nThe affected joint should be rested for approximate-\\nly 12 hours following the procedure. The joint may be\\nwrapped in an elastic bandage and the patient should\\nreceive instructions on the care and changing of the ban-\\ndage. Noises in the joint such as cracking or clicking are\\nnormal for a few days following arthrography. These\\nnoises are the result of liquid in the joints. Swelling may\\nalso occur and can be treated with application of ice or\\ncold packs. A mild pain reliever can be used to lessen\\npain in the first few days. However, if any of these symp-\\ntoms persist for more than a few days, patients are\\nadvised to contact their physician.\\nRisks\\nIn some patients iodine can cause allergic reactions,\\nranging from mild nausea to severe cardiovascular or\\nnervous system complications. Since the contrast dye is\\nput into a joint, rather than into a vein, allergic reactions\\nare rare. Facilities licensed to perform contrast exams\\nshould meet requirements for equipment, supplies and\\nstaff training to handle a possible severe reaction. Infec-\\ntion or joint damage are possible, although not frequent,\\ncomplications of arthrography.\\nNormal results\\nA normal arthrography exam will show proper\\nplacement of the dye or contrast medium throughout the\\njoint structures, joint space, cartilage and ligaments.\\nAbnormal results\\nThe abnormal placement of dye may indicate\\nrheumatoid arthritis, cysts, joint dislocation, rupture of\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2360\\nArthrography\\nAn x-ray image of the knees of a patient with cysts caused\\nby rheumatoid arthritis.The cysts appear as dark areas just\\nbelow the knee joints.(Custom Medical Stock Photo.

X rays can\\npenetrate most structures.\\nPurpose\\nThe goal of arthroplasty is to restore the function of a\\nstiffened joint and relieve pain. Two types of arthroplastic\\nsurgery exist. Joint resection involves removing a portion\\nof the bone from a stiffened joint, creating a gap between\\nthe bone and the socket, to improve the range of motion.\\nScar tissue eventually fills the gap. Pain is relieved and\\nmotion is restored, but the joint is less stable.\\nInterpositional reconstruction is surgery to reshape\\nthe joint and add a prosthetic disk between the two bones\\nforming the joint. The prosthesis can be made of plastic\\nand metal or from body tissue such as fascia and skin.\\nWhen interpositional reconstruction fails, total joint\\nreplacement may be necessary. Joint replacement is also\\ncalled total joint arthroplasty.\\nIn recent years, joint replacement has become the oper-\\nation of choice for most knee and hip problems. Elbow,\\nshoulder, ankle, and finger joints are more likely to be treat-\\ned with joint resection or interpositional reconstruction.\\nArthroplasty is performed on people suffering from\\nsevere pain and disabling joint stiffness that result from\\nosteoarthritisor rheumatoid arthritis . Joint resection,\\nrather than joint replacement, is more likely to be per-\\nformed on people with rheumatoid arthritis, especially\\nwhen the elbow joint is involved. Total joint replacement\\nis usually reserved for people over the age of 60.\\nPrecautions\\nIf both the bone and socket of a joint are damaged,\\njoint replacement is usually the preferred treatment.\\nDescription\\nArthroplasty is performed under general or regional\\nanesthesia in a hospital, by an orthopedic surgeon. Cer-\\ntain medical centers specialize in joint surgery and tend\\nto have higher success rates than less specialized centers.\\nIn joint resection, the surgeon makes an incision at\\nthe joint, then carefully removes minimum amount of\\nbone necessary to allow free motion. The more bone that\\nremains, the more stable the joint. Ligament attachments\\nare preserved as much as possible. In interpositional\\nreconstruction, both bones of the joint are reshaped, and\\na disk of material is placed between the bones to prevent\\ntheir rubbing together. Length of hospital stay depends\\non which joint is treated, but is normally only a few days.\\nPreparation\\nPrior to arthroplasty, all the standard preoperative\\nblood and urine tests are performed.

After making an incision about the size of a\\nbuttonhole in the patient’s skin, a sterile sodium chloride\\nsolution is injected to distend the joint. The arthroscope,\\nan instrument the size of a pencil, is then inserted into the\\njoint. The arthroscope has a lens and a lighting system\\nthrough which the structures inside the joint are transmit-\\nted to a miniature television camera attached to the end\\nof the arthroscope. The surgeon uses irrigation and suc-\\ntion to remove blood and debris from the joint before\\nexamining it. Other incisions may be made in order to\\nsee other parts of the joint or to insert additional instru-\\nments. Looking at the interior of the joint on the televi-\\nsion screen, the surgeon can then determine the amount\\nor type of injury and, if necessary, take a biopsy speci-\\nmen or repair or correct the problem. Arthroscopic\\nsurgery can be used to remove floating bits of cartilage\\nand treat minor tears and other disorders. When the pro-\\ncedure is finished, the arthroscope is removed and the\\njoint is irrigated. The site of the incision is bandaged.\\nArthroscopic surgery is used to diagnose and treat\\njoint problems, most commonly in the knee, but also in the\\nshoulder, elbow, ankle, wrist, and hip. Some of the most\\ncommon joint problems seen with an arthroscope are:\\n• inflammation in the knee, shoulder, elbow, wrist, or ankle\\n• injuries to the shoulder (rotator cuff tendon tears,\\nimpingement syndrome, and recurrent dislocations),\\nknee (cartilage tears, wearing down of or injury to the\\ncartilage cushion, and anterior cruciate ligament tears\\nwith instability), and wrist (carpal tunnel syndrome)\\n• loose bodies of bone and/or cartilage in the knee, shoul-\\nder, elbow, ankle, or wrist\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2362\\nArthroscopic surgery\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 362'),\n",

The procedure is performed by\\ninserting a specifically designed illuminated device into\\nthe joint through a small incision. This instrument is\\ncalled an arthroscope. The procedure of arthroscopy is\\nprimarily associated with the process of diagnosis. How-\\never, when actual repair is performed, the procedure is\\ncalled arthroscopic surgery.\\nPurpose\\nArthroscopy is used primarily by doctors who special-\\nize in treating disorders of the bones and related structures\\n(orthopedics) to help diagnose joint problems. Once\\ndescribed as essential for those who primarily care for ath-\\nletic injuries, arthroscopy is now a technique commonly\\nused by orthopedic surgeons for the treatment of patients of\\nall ages. This procedure is most commonly used to diagnose\\nknee and shoulder problems, although the elbow, hip, wrist,\\nand ankle may also be examined with an arthroscope.\\nA joint is a complex system. Within a joint, ligaments\\nattach bones to other bones, tendons attach muscles to\\nbones, cartilage lines and helps protect the ends of bones,\\nand a special fluid (synovial fluid) cushions and lubricates\\nthe structures. Looking inside the joint allows the doctors\\nto see exactly which structures are damaged. Arthroscopy\\nalso permits earlier diagnosis of many types of joint prob-\\nlems which had been difficult to detect in previous years.\\nPrecautions\\nMost arthroscopic procedures today are performed\\nin same-day surgery centers where the patient is admitted\\njust before surgery. A few hours following the procedure,\\nthe patient is allowed to return home, although usually\\nsomeone else must drive. Depending on the type of anes-\\nthesia used, the patient may be told not to eat for several\\nhours before arriving. Before the procedure, the anesthe-\\nsiologist will ask if the patient has any known allergies\\nto local or general anesthetics.

The patient’s cardiac\\nstatus should always be monitored in the event that any\\ncardiac abnormalities arise during the arthroscopy.\\nDescription\\nThe arthroscope is an instrument used to look direct-\\nly into the joint. It contains magnifying lenses and glass-\\ncoated fibers that send concentrated light into the joint. A\\ncamera attached to the arthroscope allows the surgeon to\\nsee a clear image of the joint. This image is then trans-\\nferred to a monitor located in the operating room at the\\ntime of the arthroscopy. This video technology is also\\nimportant for documentation of the arthroscopic proce-\\ndure. For example, if the surgeon decides after the arthro-\\nscopic examination that a conventional approach to sur-\\ngically expose or “open” the joint (arthrotomy) must be\\nused, a good photographic record will be useful when the\\nsurgeon returns to execute the final surgical plan.\\nThe procedure requires the surgeon to make several\\nsmall incisions (portals) through the skin’s surface into\\nthe joint. Through one or two of the portals, a large-bore\\nneedle, called a cannula, is attached to tubing and inserted\\ninto the joint. The joint is inflated with a sterile saline\\nsolution to expand the joint and ensure clear arthroscopic\\nviewing. Often, following a recent traumatic injury to a\\njoint, the joint’s natural fluid may be cloudy, making inte-\\nrior viewing of the joint difficult. In this condition, a con-\\nstant flow of the saline solution is necessary. This inflow\\nof saline solution may be through the cannula with the\\noutflow through the arthroscope, or the positions may be\\nreversed. The arthroscope is placed through one of the\\nportals to view and evaluate the condition of the joint.\\nPreparation\\nBefore an arthroscopy can take place, the surgeon\\ncompletes a thorough medical history and evaluation.\\nImportant for the accuracy of this diagnostic procedure, a\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 365\\nArthroscopy\\nArthroscope\\nSuperolateral Superomedial\\nCommon entry sites for the arthroscope\\nInferomedial\\nCentral\\nMedialLateral\\nInferolateral\\nArthroscopy is primarily used to help diagnose joint problems.This procedure, most commonly associated with knee and\\nshoulder problems, allows accurate examination and diagnosis of damaged joint ligaments, surfaces, and other related joint\\nstructures.The illustration above indicates the most common entry sites, or portals, in knee arthroscopy.(Illustration by Elec-\\ntronic Illustrators Group.)\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 365'),\n",

This is always an important preliminary step,\\nbecause pain can often be referred to a joint from another\\narea of the body. Anatomical models and pictures are use-\\nful aids to explain to the patient the proposed arthroscopy\\nand what the surgeon may be looking at specifically.\\nProper draping of the body part is important to pre-\\nvent contamination from instruments used in arthroscopy,\\nsuch as the camera, light cords, and inflow and outflow\\ndrains placed in the portals. Draping packs used in\\narthroscopy include disposable paper gowns and drapes\\nwith adhesive backing. The surgeon may also place a\\ntourniquet above the joint to temporarily block blood flow\\nto the area during the arthroscopic exam.\\nGeneral or local anesthesia may be used during\\narthroscopy. Local anesthesia is usually used because it\\nreduces the risk of lung and heart complications and\\nallows the patient to go home sooner. The local anesthet-\\nic may be injected in small amounts in multiple locations\\nin skin and joint tissues in a process called infiltration. In\\nother cases, the anesthetic is injected into the spinal cord\\nor a main nerve supplying the area. This process is called\\na “block,” and it blocks all sensation below the main\\ntrunk of the nerve. For example, a femoral block anes-\\nthetizes the leg from the thigh down (its name comes\\nfrom femur, the thighbone). Most patients are comfort-\\nable once the skin, muscles, and other tissues around the\\njoint are numbed by the anesthetic; however, some\\npatients are also given a sedative if they express anxiety\\nabout the procedure. (It’s important for the patient to\\nremain still during the arthroscopic examination.)\\nGeneral anesthesia, in which the patient becomes\\nunconcious, may be used if the procedure may be unusu-\\nally complicated or painful. For example, people who\\nhave relatively “tight” joints may be candidates for gen-\\neral anesthesia because the procedure may take longer\\nand cause more discomfort.\\nAftercare\\nThe portals are closed by small tape strips or stitches\\nand covered with dressings and a bandage. The patient\\nspends a short amount of time in the recovery room after\\narthroscopy. Most patients can go home after about an\\nhour in the recovery room. Pain medication may be pre-\\nscribed for a short period; however, many patients find\\nvarious over-the-counter pain relievers sufficient.\\nFollowing the surgical procedure, the patient needs\\nto be aware of the signs of infection, which include red-\\nness, warmth, excessive pain, and swelling. The risk of\\ninfection increases if the incisions become wet too early\\nfollowing surgery. Because of this, it is good practice to\\ncover the joint with plastic (for example, a plastic bag)\\nwhile showering after arthroscopy.\\nThe use of crutches is commonplace after arthro-\\nscopy, with progression to independent walking on an “as\\ntolerated” basis by the patient. Generally, a rehabilitation\\nprogram, supervised by a physical therapist, follows short-\\nly after the arthroscopy to help the patient regain mobility\\nand strength of the affected joint and limb.\\nRisks\\nThe incidence of complications is low compared to\\nthe high number of arthroscopic procedures performed\\nevery year. Possible complications include infection,\\nswelling, damage to the tissues in the joint, blood clots in\\nthe leg veins (thrombophlebitis ), leakage of blood into\\nthe joint (hemarthrosis), blood clots that move to the lung\\n(pulmonary embolus), and injury to the nerves around\\nthe joint.\\nNormal results\\nThe goal of arthroscopy is to diagnose a joint prob-\\nlem causing pain and/or restrictions in normal joint func-\\ntion. For example, arthroscopy can be a useful tool in\\nlocating a tear in the joint surface of the knee or locating\\na torn ligament of the shoulder. Arthroscopic examina-\\ntion is often followed by arthroscopic surgery performed\\nto repair the problem with appropriate arthroscopic tools.\\nThe final result is to decrease pain, increase joint mobili-\\nty, and thereby improve the overall quality of the\\npatient’s activities of daily living.\\nAbnormal results\\nLess optimal results that may require further treat-\\nment include adhesive capsulitis. In this condition, the\\njoint capsule that naturally forms around the joint\\nbecomes thickened, forming adhesions. This results in a\\nstiff and less mobile joint. This problem is frequently\\ncorrected by manipulation and mobilization of the joint\\nwith the patient placed under general anesthesia.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nCasscells, Ward S.

Tardieu and Simon\\nviewed art therapy as an effective diagnostic tool to iden-\\ntify specific types of mental illness or traumatic events.\\nLater, psychologists would use this diagnostic aspect to\\ndevelop psychological drawing tests (the Draw-A-Man\\ntest, the Draw-A-Person Questionnaire [DAP.Q]) and\\nprojective personality tests involving visual symbol\\nrecognition (e.g., the Rorschach Inkblot Test, the The-\\nmatic Apperception Test [TAT], and the Holtzman\\nInkblot Test [HIT]).\\nThe growing popularity of milieu therapies at psy-\\nchiatric institutions in the twentieth century was an\\nimportant factor in the development of art therapy in the\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 367\\nArt therapy\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 367'),\n",

Today, she is considered the\\nfounder of art therapy in the United States.\\nIn the 1930s, Karl, William, and Charles Menninger\\nintroduced an art therapy program at their Kansas-based\\npsychiatric hospital, the Menninger Clinic. The Men-\\nninger Clinic employed a number of artists in residence\\nin the following years, and the facility was also consid-\\nered a leader in the art therapy movement through the\\n1950s and 60s. Other noted art therapy pioneers who\\nemerged in the 50s and 60s include Edith Kramer, Hanna\\nYaxa Kwiatkowska (National Institute of Mental Health),\\nand Janie Rhyne.\\nArt therapy, sometimes called expressive art or art\\npsychology, encourages self-discovery and emotional\\ngrowth. It is a two part process, involving both the cre-\\nation of art and the discovery of its meaning. Rooted in\\nFreud and Jung’s theories of the subconscious and\\nunconscious, art therapy is based on the assumption that\\nvisual symbols and images are the most accessible and\\nnatural form of communication to the human experience.\\nPatients are encouraged to visualize, and then create, the\\nthoughts and emotions that they cannot talk about. The\\nresulting artwork is then reviewed and its meaning inter-\\npreted by the patient.\\nThe “analysis” of the artwork produced in art thera-\\npy typically allows patients to gain some level of insight\\ninto their feelings and lets them to work through these\\nissues in a constructive manner. Art therapy is typically\\npracticed with individual, group, or family psychothera-\\npy (talk therapy). While a therapist may provide critical\\nguidance for these activities, a key feature of effective art\\ntherapy is that the patient/artist, not the therapist, directs\\nthe interpretation of the artwork.\\nArt therapy can be a particularly useful treatment\\ntool for children, who frequently have limited language\\nskills. By drawing or using other visual means to express\\ntroublesome feelings, younger patients can begin to\\naddress these issues, even if they cannot identify or label\\nthese emotions with words. Art therapy is also valuable\\nfor adolescents and adults who are unable or unwilling to\\ntalk about thoughts and feelings.\\nBeyond its use in mental health treatment, art thera-\\npy is also used with traditional medicine to treat organic\\ndiseases and conditions. The connection between mental\\nand physical health is well documented, and art therapy\\ncan promote healing by relieving stress and allowing the\\npatient to develop coping skills.\\nArt therapy has traditionally centered on visual\\nmediums, like paintings, sculptures, and drawings. Some\\nmental healthcare providers have now broadened the def-\\ninition to include music, film, dance, writing, and other\\ntypes of artistic expression.\\nArt therapy is often one part of a psychiatric inpatient\\nor outpatient treatment program, and can take place in\\nindividual or group therapy sessions. Group art therapy\\nsessions often take place in hospital, clinic, shelter, and\\ncommunity program settings. These group therapy ses-\\nsions can have the added benefits of positive social inter-\\naction, empathy, and support from peers. The client-artist\\ncan learn that others have similar concerns and issues.\\nPreparations\\nBefore starting art therapy, the therapist may have an\\nintroductory session with the client-artist to discuss art\\ntherapy techniques and give the client the opportunity to\\nask questions about the process. The client-artist’s comfort\\nwith the artistic process is critical to successful art therapy.\\nThe therapist ensures that appropriate materials and\\nspace are available for the client-artist, as well as an ade-\\nquate amount of time for the session. If the individual\\nartist is exploring art as therapy without the guidance of a\\ntrained therapist, adequate materials, space, and time are\\nstill important factors in a successful creative experience.\\nThe supplies used in art therapy are limited only by\\nthe artist’s (and/or therapist’s) imagination. Some of the\\nmaterials often used include paper, canvas, poster board,\\nassorted paints, inks, markers, pencils, charcoals, chalks,\\nfabrics, string, adhesives, clay, wood, glazes, wire, bend-\\nable metals, and natural items (like shells, leaves, etc.).\\nProviding artists with a variety of materials in assorted\\ncolors and textures can enhance their interest in the\\nprocess and may result in a richer, more diverse explo-\\nration of their emotions in the resulting artwork. Appro-\\npriate tools such as scissors, brushes, erasers, easels, sup-\\nply trays, glue guns, smocks or aprons, and cleaning\\nmaterials are also essential.\\nAn appropriate workspace should be available for\\nthe creation of art. Ideally, this should be a bright, quiet,\\ncomfortable place, with large tables, counters, or other\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2368\\nArt therapy\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 368'),\n",

The space can be as simple as a kitchen\\nor office table, or as fancy as a specialized artist’s studio.\\nThe artist should have adequate time to become\\ncomfortable with and explore the creative process. This\\nis especially true for people who do not consider them-\\nselves “artists” and may be uncomfortable with the con-\\ncept. If performed in a therapy group or one-on-one ses-\\nsion, the art therapist should be available to answer gen-\\neral questions about materials and/or the creative\\nprocess. However, the therapist should be careful not to\\ninfluence the creation or interpretation of the work.\\nPrecautions\\nArt materials and techniques should match the age\\nand ability of the client. People with impairments, such\\nas traumatic brain injury or an organic neurological con-\\ndition, may have difficulties with the self-discovery por-\\ntion of the art therapy process depending on their level of\\nfunctioning. However, they may still benefit from art\\ntherapy through the sensory stimulation it provides and\\nthe pleasure they get from artistic creation.\\nWhile art is accessible to all (with or without a ther-\\napist to guide the process), it may be difficult to tap the\\nfull potential of the interpretive part of art therapy with-\\nout a therapist to guide the process. When art therapy is\\nchosen as a therapeutic tool to cope with a physical con-\\ndition, it should be treated as a supplemental therapy and\\nnot as a substitute for conventional medical treatments.\\nResearch and general acceptance\\nA wide body of literature supports the use of art\\ntherapy in a mental health capacity. And as the mind-\\nbody connection between psychological well-being and\\nphysical health is further documented by studies in the\\nfield, art therapy gains greater acceptance by mainstream\\nmedicine as a therapeutic technique for organic illness.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nFausek, Diane.

It is not contagious.\\nDescription\\nAsbestosis is a consequence of prolonged exposure\\nto large quantities of asbestos, a material once widely\\nused in construction, insulation, and manufacturing.\\nWhen asbestos is inhaled, fibers penetrate the breathing\\npassages and irritate, fill, inflame, and scar lung tissue. In\\nadvanced asbestosis,, the lungs shrink, stiffen, and\\nbecome honeycombed (riddled with tiny holes).\\nLegislation has reduced use of asbestos in the United\\nStates, but workers who handle automobile brake shoe\\nlinings, boiler insulation, ceiling acoustic tiles, electrical\\nequipment, and fire-resistant materials are still exposed\\nto the substance. Asbestos is used in the production of\\npaints and plastics. Significant amounts can be released\\ninto the atmosphere when old buildings or boats are\\nrazed or remodeled.\\nAsbestosis is most common in men over 40 who\\nhave worked in asbestos-related occupations. Smokers or\\nheavy drinkers have the greatest risk of developing this\\ndisease. Between 1968 and 1992, more than 10,000\\nAmericans over the age of 15 died as a result of asbesto-\\nsis.

Family members can\\ndevelop the disease as a result of inhaling particles of\\nasbestos dust that cling to workers’ clothes.\\nIt is rare for asbestosis to develop in anyone who\\nhasn’t been exposed to large amounts of asbestos on a\\nregular basis for at least 10 years. Symptoms of the dis-\\nease do not usually appear until 15–20 years after initial\\nexposure to asbestos.\\nThe first symptom of asbestosis is usually shortness\\nof breath following exercise or other physical activity.\\nThe early stages of the disease are also characterized by a\\ndry cough and a generalized feeling of illness.\\nAs the disease progresses and lung damage increas-\\nes, shortness of breath occurs even when the patient is at\\nrest. Recurrent respiratory infections and coughing up\\nblood are common. So is swelling of the feet, ankles, or\\nhands. Other symptoms of advanced asbestosis include\\nchest pain, hoarseness, and restless sleep. Patients who\\nhave asbestosis often have clubbed (widened and thick-\\nened) fingers. Other potential complications include\\nheart failure, collapsed (deflated) lung, and pleurisy\\n(inflammation of the membrane that protects the lung).\\nDiagnosis\\nScreening of at-risk workers can reveal lung inflamma-\\ntion and lesions characteristic of asbestosis. Patients’ med-\\nical histories can identify occupations, hobbies, or other sit-\\nuations likely to involve exposure to asbestos fibers.\\nX rays can show shadows or spots on the lungs or an\\nindistinct or shaggy outline of the heart that suggests the\\npresence of asbestosis. Blood tests are used to measure\\nconcentrations of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Pulmonary\\nfunction tests can be used to assess a patient’s ability to\\ninhale and exhale, and a computed tomography scan\\n(CT) of the lungs can show flat, raised patches associated\\nwith advanced asbestosis.\\nTreatment\\nThe goal of treatment is to help patients breathe\\nmore easily, prevent colds and other respiratory infec-\\ntions, and control complications associated with\\nadvanced disease. Ultrasonic, cool-mist humidifiers or\\ncontrolled coughing can loosen bronchial secretions.\\nRegular exercise helps maintain and improve lung\\ncapacity. Although temporary bed rest may be recom-\\nmended, patients are encouraged to resume their regular\\nactivities as soon as they can.\\nAntibiotics may be prescribed to combat infection.\\nAspirin or acetominophen (Tylenol) can relieve minor\\ndiscomfort and bronchodilators that are swallowed or\\ninhaled can relax and widen breathing passages.\\nDiuretics (drugs that increase urine production and\\nexcretion) or digitalis glycoside ( Digitalis purpurea) are\\nprescribed for some patients. Others may need to use\\nsupplemental oxygen or use less salt.\\nAnyone who develops symptoms of asbestosis\\nshould see a family physician or lung disease specialist.\\nA doctor should be notified if someone who has been\\ndiagnosed with asbestosis:\\n• coughs up blood\\n• continues to lose weight\\n• is short of breath\\n• has chest pain\\n• develops a sudden fever of 101°F (38.3°C) or higher\\n• develops unfamiliar, unexplained symptoms\\nPrognosis\\nAsbestosis can’t be cured, but its symptoms can be\\ncontrolled. Doctors don’t know why the health of some\\npatients deteriorates and the condition of others remain\\nthe same, but believe the difference may be due to vary-\\ning exposures of asbestos.

It functions to keep fluid inside the\\nblood vessels.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nThe two most important factors in the production of\\nascites due to chronic liver disease are:\\n• Low levels of albumin in the blood that cause a change\\nin the pressure necessary to prevent fluid exchange\\n(osmotic pressure). This change in pressure allows fluid\\nto seep out of the blood vessels.\\n• An increase in the pressure within the branches of the\\nportal vein that run through liver (portal hypertension).\\nPortal hypertension is caused by the scarring that\\noccurs in cirrhosis. Blood that cannot flow through the\\nliver because of the increased pressure leaks into the\\nabdomen and causes ascites.\\nOther conditions that contribute to ascites develop-\\nment include:\\n• hepatitis\\n• heart or kidney failure\\n• inflammation and fibrous hardening of the sac that con-\\ntains the heart (constrictive pericarditis)\\nPersons who have systemic lupus erythematosus\\nbut do not have liver disease or portal hypertension occa-\\nsionally develop ascites. Depressed thyroid activity\\nsometimes causes pronounced ascites, but inflammation\\nof the pancreas (pancreatitis ) rarely causes significant\\naccumulations of fluid.\\nSymptoms\\nSmall amounts of fluid in the abdomen do not usual-\\nly produce symptoms. Massive accumulations may cause:\\n• rapid weight gain\\n• abdominal discomfort and distention\\n• shortness of breath\\n• swollen ankles\\nDiagnosis\\nSkin stretches tightly across an abdomen that con-\\ntains large amounts of fluid. The navel bulges or lies flat,\\nand the fluid makes a dull sound when the doctor taps the\\nabdomen. Ascitic fluid may cause the flanks to bulge.\\nPhysical examination generally enables doctors to\\ndistinguish ascites from pregnancy, intestinal gas, obe-\\nsity, or ovarian tumors. Ultrasound or computed tomog-\\nraphy scans (CT) can detect even small amounts of\\nfluid. Laboratory analysis of fluid extracted by inserting\\na needle through the abdominal wall (diagnostic para-\\ncentesis) can help identify the cause of the accumulation.\\nTreatment\\nReclining minimizes the amount of salt the kidneys\\nabsorb, so treatment generally starts with bed rest and a\\nlow-salt diet. Urine-producing drugs (diuretics) may be\\nprescribed if initial treatment is ineffective. The weight\\nand urinary output of patients using diuretics must be\\ncarefully monitored for signs of :\\n• hypovolemia (massive loss of blood or fluid)\\n• azotemia (abnormally high blood levels of nitrogen-\\nbearing materials)\\n• potassium imbalance\\n• high sodium concentration. If the patient consumes\\nmore salt than the kidneys excrete, increased doses of\\ndiuretics should be prescribed\\nModerate-to-severe accumulations of fluid are treat-\\ned by draining large amounts of fluid (large-volume\\nparacentesis) from the patient’s abdomen.

Aspergillo-\\nsis fungal infections can occur in the ear canal, eyes,\\nnose, sinus cavities, and lungs. In some individuals, the\\ninfection can even invade bone and the membranes that\\nenclose the brain and spinal cord (meningitis).\\nDescription\\nAspergillosis is primarily an infection of the lungs\\ncaused by the inhalation of airborne spores of the fungus\\nAspergillus. Spores are the small particles that most\\nfungi use to reproduce. Although virtually everyone is\\nexposed to this fungus in their daily environment, it\\nrarely causes disease. When Aspergillus does cause dis-\\nease, however, it usually occurs in those individuals with\\nweakened immune systems (immunocompromised) or\\nwho have a history of respiratory ailments. Because it\\ndoes not present distinctive symptoms, aspergillosis is\\ngenerally thought to be underdiagnosed and underre-\\nported. Furthermore, many patients with the more severe\\nforms of aspergillosis tend to have multiple, complex\\nhealth problems, such as AIDS or a blood disorder like\\nleukemia, which can further complicate diagnosis and\\ntreatment.\\nOnce considered particularly rare, the incidence of\\nreported aspergillosis has risen somewhat with the devel-\\nopment of more sophisticated methods of diagnosis and\\nadvances made in other areas of medicine, such as with\\nthe increased use of certain chemotherapeutic and corti-\\ncosteroid drugs that are extremely useful in treating vari-\\nous types of cancer but that decrease the individual’s\\nimmune response, making them more susceptible to\\nother diseases like aspergillosis.\\nOur advanced ability to perform tissue and organ\\ntransplants has also increased the number of people vul-\\nnerable to fungal infections. Transplant recipients, partic-\\nularly those receiving bone marrow or heart transplants,\\nare highly susceptible to Aspergillus, which may be cir-\\nculating in the hospital air.\\nAspergillosis can be a serious, potentially deadly\\nthreat for two primary reasons:\\n• Aspergillosis usually occurs in those individuals who\\nare already ill or have weakened immune systems, such\\nas patients who have undergone chemotherapy for\\ncancer.\\n• None of the currently available antifungal drugs are\\nreliably effective against Aspergillus.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAspergillusis a fungus that is found almost everywhere,\\nbut particularly in soil, water, decaying vegetation, and\\nstored grain. The fungus has also been cultured from ventila-\\ntion systems and may be stirred up during building renova-\\ntions. The species most commonly identified in patients with\\nconfirmed disease are A. fumigatusand A. flavus.\\nAirborne Aspergillus spores enter the body primarily\\nthrough inhalation but can also lodge in the ear or eye.\\nNormally functioning immune systems are generally able\\nto cope without consequent development of aspergillosis.\\nIt is important to make distinctions between the vari-\\nous forms of aspergillosis, as the treatment and prognosis\\nvaries considerably among types. Aspergillosis as a diag-\\nnosis refers to three general forms:\\n• Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is\\nseen in patients with long-standing asthma, particular-\\nly in patients taking oral corticosteroids for a long\\nperiod of time. This is usually the least serious and\\nmost treatable form.\\n• Aspergilloma refers to the mass formed when fungal\\nspores settle into or colonize areas of the lung that have\\nbeen pitted and scarred as a result of tuberculosis or\\nprior pneumonia. There are several available treatments,\\nalthough the success rate varies with each treatment.\\n• Invasive fungal infection refers to rare cases in which\\nthe fungus spreads throughout the body via the blood\\nstream and invades other organ systems. Once estab-\\nlished, invasive fungal infections are extremely difficult\\nto cure and, as a result, the associated death rate is\\nextremely high.\\nAspergillus infection of the ear (called otomycosis),\\ncan produce itching and a discharge, sometimes noticed\\nas a spot on the pillow. Fungal infection of the cornea of\\nthe eye in a susceptible person can result in blindness, if\\nnot diagnosed and treated promptly.\\nDiagnosis\\nAspergillosis can be quite difficult to diagnose\\nbecause the symptoms, such as coughing and wheezing,\\nif present at all, are common to many respiratory disor-\\nders. Furthermore, blood and sputum cultures are not\\nvery helpful. The presence of Aspergillus is so common,\\neven in asthmatics, that a positive culture alone is insuffi-\\ncient for a diagnosis. Other, potentially more useful,\\nscreening tools include examining the sample obtained\\nafter repeatedly washing the bronchial tubes of the lung\\nwith water (bronchial lavage), but examining a tissue\\nsample (biopsy) is the most reliable diagnostic tool.\\nResearchers are currently attempting to develop a practi-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 375\\nAspergillosis\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 375'),\n",

Brown flecks\\nor clumps may be seen in the sputum. Pulmonary func-\\ntion tests may show decreased blood flow, suggesting an\\nobstruction within the lungs. Elevated blood levels of an\\nantibody produced in response to Aspergillus and of cer-\\ntain immune system cells may indicate a specific aller-\\ngic-type immune system response.\\nA fungal mass (aspergilloma) in the lung usually\\ndoes not produce clear symptoms and is generally diag-\\nnosed when seen on chest x rays. However, 70% or more\\nof patients spit up blood from the lungs (hemoptysis) at\\nleast once, and this may become repetitive and serious.\\nHemoptysis, then, is another indication that the patient\\nmay be suffering from an aspergilloma.\\nIn patients with lowered immune systems who are at\\nrisk for developing invasive aspergillosis, the physician\\nmay use a combination of blood culture with visual diag-\\nnostic techniques, such as computed tomography scans\\n(CT) and radiography, to arrive at a likely diagnosis.\\nTreatment\\nThe treatment method selected depends on the form\\nof aspergillosis. ABPA can usually be treated with many\\nof the same drugs used to treat asthma, such as systemic\\nsteroids. Long-term therapy may be required, however, to\\nprevent recurrence. Antifungal agents are not recom-\\nmended in the treatment of ABPA. In cases of aspergillo-\\nma, it may become necessary to surgically remove or\\nreduce the size of a fungal mass, especially if the patient\\ncontinues to spit up blood. In aspergillosis cases affecting\\nthe nose and nasal sinuses, surgery may also be required.\\nIn non-ABPA cases, the use of antifungal drugs may\\nbe indicated. In such cases, amphotericin B (Fungizone)\\nis the first-line therapy. The prescribed dose will depend\\non the patient’s condition but usually begins with a small\\ntest dose and then escalates. Less than one-third of\\npatients are likely to respond to amphotericin B, and its\\nside effects often limit its use. For patients who do not\\nrespond to oral amphotericin B, another option is a dif-\\nferent formulation of the same drug called liposomal\\namphotericin B.\\nFor patients who fail to respond or who cannot toler-\\nate amphotericin B, another drug called itraconazole\\n(Sporanox), given 400-600 mg daily, has also been\\napproved. Treatment generally lasts about 3 months. Giv-\\ning itraconazole can produce adverse reactions if pre-\\nscribed in combination with certain other drugs by\\nincreasing the concentrations of both drugs in the blood\\nand creating a potentially life-threatening situation. Even\\nantacidscan significantly affect itraconazole levels. As a\\nresult, drug levels must be continually monitored to\\nensure that absorption is occurring at acceptable levels.\\nTwo other methods of treatment are being studied:\\ndirect instillation of an antifungal agent into the lungs\\nand administration of antifungals using a nebulizer.\\nInstilling or injecting amphotericin B or itraconazole\\ndirectly into the lung cavity or into the fungal ball\\n(aspergilloma) itself has been helpful in stopping\\nepisodes of hemoptysis, but not in preventing future\\nrecurrences. Furthermore, many patients with aspergillo-\\nmas are poor risks for surgery because their lung func-\\ntion is already compromised. As a result, instillation of a\\nfungal agent should only be considered in those who\\nhave significant hempotysis.\\nA popular method of treating some respiratory dis-\\norders is to add a liquid drug to another carrier liquid and\\naerosolize or produce a fine mist that can be inhaled into\\nthe lungs through a device called a nebulizer. However,\\nthis has not yet been shown to improve the patient’s con-\\ndition in cases of aspergillosis, possibly because the drug\\nis not reaching the aspergilloma.\\nAt this point, preventative therapy for aspergillosis is\\nnot suggested for susceptible individuals, primarily\\nbecause overuse of the drugs used to fight fungal infec-\\ntions may lead to the development of drug-resistant\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2376\\nAspergillosis\\nAspergillus\\nAspergillosis is an infection of the lungs caused by inhala-\\ntion of airborne spores of the fungus Aspergillus.

Some people take aspirin\\ndaily to reduce the risk of stroke, heart attack, or other\\nheart problems.\\nDescription\\nAspirin—also known as acetylsalicylic acid—is sold\\nover the counter and comes in many forms, from the\\nfamiliar white tablets to chewing gum and rectal supposi-\\ntories. Coated, chewable, buffered, and extended release\\nforms are available. Many other over-the-counter medi-\\ncine contain aspirin. Alka-Seltzer Original Effervescent\\nAntacid Pain Reliever, for example, contains aspirin for\\npain relief and sodium bicarbonate to relieve acid indi-\\ngestion, heartburn, and sour stomach.\\nAspirin belongs to a group of drugs called salicy-\\nlates. Other members of this group include sodium salicy-\\nlate, choline salicylate, and magnesium salicylate. These\\ndrugs are more expensive and no more effective than\\naspirin. However, they are a little easier on the stomach.\\nAspirin is quickly absorbed into the bloodstream and pro-\\nvides quick and relatively long-lasting pain relief. Aspirin\\nalso reduces inflammation. Researchers believe these\\neffects come about because aspirin blocks the production\\nof pain-producing chemicals called prostaglandins.\\nIn addition to relieving pain and reducing inflamma-\\ntion, aspirin also lowers fever by acting on the part of the\\nbrain that regulates temperature.

Aspirin can cause Reye’s syndrome, a life-\\nthreatening condition that affects the nervous system and\\nliver. As many as 30% of children and teenagers who\\ndevelop Reye’s syndrome die. Those who survive may\\nhave permanent brain damage.\\nCheck with a physician before giving aspirin to a\\nchild under 12 years for arthritis, rheumatism, or any\\ncondition that requires long-term use of the drug.\\nNo one should take aspirin for more than 10 days in\\na row unless told to do so by a physician. Anyone with\\nfever should not take aspirin for more than 3 days with-\\nout a physician’s consent. Do not to take more than the\\nrecommended daily dosage.\\nPeople in the following categories should not use\\naspirin without first checking with their physician:\\n• Pregnant women.

Obstruction to air flow either stops sponta-\\nneously or responds to a wide range of treatments, but\\ncontinuing inflammation makes the airways hyper-\\nresponsive to stimuli such as cold air,exercise , dust\\nmites, pollutants in the air, and even stress and anxiety.\\nDescription\\nAbout 10 million Americans have asthma, and the\\nnumber seems to be increasing. Between 1982-92, the\\nrate actually rose by 42%. Not only is asthma becoming\\nmore frequent, but it also is a more severe disease than\\nbefore, despite modern drug treatments. In the same 10-\\nyear period, the death rate from asthma in the United\\nStates increased by 35%.\\nThe changes that take place in the lungs of asth-\\nmatic persons makes the airways (the “breathing tubes,”\\nor bronchi and the smaller bronchioles ) hyper-reactive\\nto many different types of stimuli that don’t affect\\nhealthy lungs. In an asthma attack, the muscle tissue in\\nthe walls of bronchi go into spasm, and the cells lining\\nthe airways swell and secrete mucus into the air spaces.\\nBoth these actions cause the bronchi to become nar-\\nrowed (bronchoconstriction). As a result, an asthmatic\\nperson has to make a much greater effort to breathe in\\nair and to expel it.\\nCells in the bronchial walls, called mast cells,\\nrelease certain substances that cause the bronchial mus-\\ncle to contract and stimulate mucus formation. These\\nsubstances, which include histamine and a group of\\nchemicals called leukotrienes, also bring white blood\\ncells into the area, which is a key part of the inflammato-\\nry response. Many patients with asthma are prone to\\nreact to such “foreign” substances as pollen, house dust\\nmites, or animal dander; these are called allergens. On\\nthe other hand, asthma affects many patients who are not\\n“allergic” in this way.\\nAsthma usually begins in childhood or adolescence,\\nbut it also may first appear during adult years. While the\\nsymptoms may be similar, certain important aspects of\\nasthma are different in children and adults.\\nChild-onset asthma\\nWhen asthma does begin in childhood, it often does\\nso in a child who is likely, for genetic reasons, to become\\nsensitized to common “allergens” in the environment\\n(atopic person). When these children are exposed to\\nhouse-dust mites, animal proteins, fungi, or other poten-\\ntial allergens, they produce a type of antibody that is\\nintended to engulf and destroy the foreign materials. This\\nhas the effect of making the airway cells sensitive to par-\\nticular materials. Further exposure can lead rapidly to an\\nasthmatic response. This condition of atopy is present in\\nat least one-third and as many as half of the general pop-\\nulation. When an infant or young child wheezes during\\nviral infections, the presence of allergy (in the child itself\\nor a close relative) is a clue that asthma may well contin-\\nue throughout childhood.\\nAdult-onset asthma\\nAllergenic materials may also play a role when\\nadults become asthmatic. Asthma can actually start at\\nany age and in a wide variety of situations. Many adults\\nwho are not allergic do have such conditions as sinusitis\\nor nasal polyps, or they may be sensitive to aspirin and\\nrelated drugs. Another major source of adult asthma is\\nexposure at work to animal products, certain forms of\\nplastic, wood dust, or metals.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nIn most cases, asthma is caused by inhaling an aller-\\ngen that sets off the chain of biochemical and tissue\\nchanges leading to airway inflammation, bronchocon-\\nstriction, and wheezing. Because avoiding (or at least\\nminimizing) exposure is the most effective way of treat-\\ning asthma, it is vital to identify which allergen or irritant\\nis causing symptoms in a particular patient. Once asthma\\nis present, symptoms can be set off or made worse if the\\npatient also has rhinitis (inflammation of the lining of\\nthe nose) or sinusitis. When, for some reason, stomach\\nacid passes back up the esophagus (acid reflux), this can\\nalso make asthma worse. A viral infection of the respira-\\ntory tract can also inflame an asthmatic reaction. Aspirin\\nand a type of drug called beta-blockers, often used to\\ntreat high blood pressure, can also worsen the symptoms\\nof asthma.\\nThe most important inhaled allergens giving rise to\\nattacks of asthma are:\\n• animal dander\\n• mites in house dust\\n• fungi (molds) that grow indoors\\n• cockroach allergens\\n• pollen\\n• occupational exposure to chemicals, fumes, or particles\\nof industrial materials in the air\\nInhaling tobacco smoke, either by smoking or being\\nnear people who are smoking, can irritate the airways\\nand trigger an asthmatic attack. Air pollutants can have a\\nsimilar effect. In addition, there are three important fac-\\ntors that regularly produce attacks in certain asthmatic\\npatients, and they may sometimes be the sole cause of\\nsymptoms.

Besides wheezing\\nand being short of breath, the patient may cough and\\nmay report a feeling of “tightness” in the chest. Children\\nmay have itching on their back or neck at the start of an\\nattack. Wheezing is often loudest when the patient\\nbreathes out, in an attempt to expel used air through the\\nnarrowed airways. Some asthmatics are free of symp-\\ntoms most of the time but may occasionally be short of\\nbreath for a brief time. Others spend much of their days\\n(and nights) coughing and wheezing, until properly treat-\\ned. Crying or even laughing may bring on an attack.\\nSevere episodes are often seen when the patient gets a\\nviral respiratory tract infection or is exposed to a heavy\\nload of an allergen or irritant. Asthmatic attacks may last\\nonly a few minutes or can go on for hours or even days (a\\ncondition called status asthmaticus).\\nBeing short of breath may cause a patient to become\\nvery anxious, sit upright, lean forward, and use the mus-\\ncles of the neck and chest wall to help breathe. The\\npatient may be able to say only a few words at a time\\nbefore stopping to take a breath. Confusion and a bluish\\ntint to the skin are clues that the oxygen supply is much\\ntoo low, and that emergency treatment is needed. In a\\nsevere attack that lasts for some time, some of the air\\nsacs in the lung may rupture so that air collects within\\nthe chest. This makes it even harder to breathe in enough\\nair. Almost always, even patients with the most severe\\nattacks will recover completely.\\nDiagnosis\\nApart from listening to the patient’s chest, the exam-\\niner should look for maximum chest expansion while\\ntaking in air. Hunched shoulders and contracting neck\\nmuscles are other signs of narrowed airways. Nasal\\npolyps or increased amounts of nasal secretions are often\\nnoted in asthmatic patients. Skin changes, like atopic\\ndermatitis or eczema, are a tipoff that the patient has\\nallergic problems.\\nInquiring about a family history of asthma or aller-\\ngies can be a valuable indicator of asthma. The diagnosis\\nmay be strongly suggested when typical symptoms and\\nsigns are present. A test called spirometry measures how\\nrapidly air is exhaled and how much is retained in the\\nlungs. Repeating the test after the patient inhales a drug\\nthat widens the air passages (a bronchodilator) will show\\nwhether the airway narrowing is reversible, which is a\\nvery typical finding in asthma. Often patients use a relat-\\ned instrument, called a peak flow meter, to keep track of\\nasthma severity when at home.\\nOften, it is difficult to determine what is triggering\\nasthma attacks. Allergy skin testing may be used,\\nalthough an allergic skin response does not always mean\\nthat the allergen being tested is causing the asthma. Also,\\nthe body’s immune system produces antibody to fight off\\nthe allergen, and the amount of antibody can be mea-\\nsured by a blood test. This will show how sensitive the\\npatient is to a particular allergen. If the diagnosis is still\\nin doubt, the patient can inhale a suspect allergen while\\nusing a spirometer to detect airway narrowing. Spirome-\\ntry can also be repeated after a bout of exercise if exer-\\ncise-induced asthma is a possibility. A chest x ray will\\nhelp rule out other disorders.\\nTreatment\\nPatients should be periodically examined and have\\ntheir lung function measured by spirometry to make sure\\nthat treatment goals are being met. These goals are to pre-\\nvent troublesome symptoms, to maintain lung function as\\nclose to normal as possible, and to allow patients to pur-\\nsue their normal activities including those requiring exer-\\ntion. The best drug therapy is that which controls asthmat-\\nic symptoms while causing few or no side-effects.\\nDrugs\\nMETHYLXANTHINES. The chief methylxanthine drug\\nis theophylline. It may exert some anti-inflammatory\\neffect, and is especially helpful in controlling nighttime\\nsymptoms of asthma. When, for some reason, a patient\\ncannot use an inhaler to maintain long-term control, sus-\\ntained-release theophylline is a good alternative. The\\nblood levels of the drug must be measured periodically,\\nas too high a dose can cause an abnormal heart rhythm or\\nconvulsions.\\nBETA-RECEPTOR AGONISTS. These drugs, which are\\nbronchodilators, are the best choice for relieving sudden\\nattacks of asthma and for preventing attacks from being\\ntriggered by exercise. Some agonists, such as albuterol,\\nact mainly in lung cells and have little effect on other\\norgans, such as the heart.

Typically, increasing amounts of the allergen are\\ninjected over a period of three to five years, so that the\\nbody can build up an effective immune response.

It is most important for a patient suffering an\\nacute attack to be given extra oxygen. Rarely, it may be\\nnecessary to use a mechanical ventilator to help the\\npatient breathe. A beta-receptor agonist is inhaled repeat-\\nedly or continuously. If the patient does not respond\\npromptly and completely, a steroid is given. A course of\\nsteroid therapy, given after the attack is over, will make a\\nrecurrence less likely.\\nMaintaining control\\nLong-term asthma treatment is based on inhaling a\\nbeta-receptor agonist using a special inhaler that meters the\\ndose. Patients must be instructed in proper use of an inhaler\\nto be sure that it will deliver the right amount of drug. Once\\nasthma has been controlled for several weeks or months, it\\nis worth trying to cut down on drug treatment, but this must\\nbe done gradually. The last drug added should be the first to\\nbe reduced. Patients should be seen every one to six\\nmonths, depending on the frequency of attacks.\\nStarting treatment at home, rather than in hospital,\\nmakes for minimal delay and helps the patient to gain a\\nsense of control over the disease. All patients should be\\ntaught how to monitor their symptoms so that they will\\nknow when an attack is starting, and those with moderate\\nor severe asthma should know how to use a flow meter.\\nThey should also have a written “action plan” to follow if\\nsymptoms suddenly become worse, including how to\\nadjust their medication and when to seek medical help. If\\nmore intense treatment is necessary, it should be contin-\\nued for several days. Over-the-counter “remedies” should\\nbe avoided. When deciding whether a patient should be\\nhospitalized, the past history of acute attacks, severity of\\nsymptoms, current medication, and whether good support\\nis available at home all must be taken into account.\\nReferral to an asthma specialist should be considered if:\\n• there has been a life-threatening asthma attack or\\nsevere, persistent asthma\\n• treatment for three to six months has not met its goals\\n• some other condition, such as nasal polyps or chronic\\nlung disease, is complicating asthma\\n• special tests, such as allergy skin testing or an allergen\\nchallenge, are needed\\n• intensive steroid therapy has been necessary\\nSpecial populations\\nINFANTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN. It is especially\\nimportant to closely watch the course of asthma in young\\npatients. Treatment is cut down when possible and if\\nthere is no clear improvement, some other treatment\\nshould be tried. If a viral infection leads to severe asth-\\nmatic symptoms, steroids may help. The health care\\nprovider should write out an asthma treatment plan for\\nthe child’s school. Asthmatic children often need med-\\nication at school to control acute symptoms or to prevent\\nexercise- induced attacks. Proper management will usu-\\nally allow a child to take part in play activities. Only as a\\nlast resort should activities be limited.\\nTHE ELDERLY. Older persons often have other types of\\nobstructive lung disease, such as chronic bronchitis or\\nemphysema. This makes it important to know to what\\nextent the symptoms are caused by asthma. Giving steroids\\nfor two to three weeks can help determine this. Side-effects\\nfrom beta-receptor agonist drugs (including a speeding\\nheart and tremor) may be more common in older patients.\\nThese patients may benefit from receiving an anti-choliner-\\ngic drug, along with the beta-receptor agonist. If theo-\\nphylline is given, the dose should be limited, as older\\npatients are less able to clear this drug from their blood.\\nSteroids should be avoided, as they often make elderly\\npatients confused and agitated. Steroids may also further\\nweaken the bones.\\nPrognosis\\nMost patients with asthma respond well when the\\nbest drug or combination of drugs is found, and they are\\nable to lead relatively normal lives. More than half of\\naffected children stop having attacks by the time they\\nreach 21 years of age. Many others have less frequent\\nand less severe attacks as they grow older.

Cramer, MD\\nAstigmatism\\nDefinition\\nAstigmatism is the result of an inability of the\\ncornea to properly focus an image onto the retina. The\\nresult is a blurred image.\\nDescription\\nThe cornea is the outermost part of the eye. It is a\\ntransparent layer that covers the colored part of the eye\\n(iris), pupil, and lens. The cornea bends light and helps to\\nfocus it onto the retina where specialized cells (photo\\nreceptors) detect light and transmit nerve impulses via\\nthe optic nerve to the brain where the image is formed.\\nThe cornea is dome shaped. Any incorrect shaping of the\\ncornea results in an incorrect focusing of the light that\\npasses through that part of the cornea. The bending of\\nlight is called refraction and focusing problems with the\\ncornea are called diseases of refraction or refractive dis-\\norders. Astigmatism is an image distortion that results\\nfrom an improperly shaped cornea. Usually the cornea is\\nspherically shaped, like a baseball. However, in astigma-\\ntism the cornea is elliptically shaped, more like a foot-\\nball. There is a long meridian and a short meridian.\\nThese two meridians generally have a constant curvature\\nand are generally perpendicular to each other (regular\\nastigmatism). Irregular astigmatism may have more than\\ntwo meridians of focus and they may not be 90° apart. A\\npoint of light, therefore, going through an astigmatic\\ncornea will have two points of focus, instead of one nice\\nsharp image on the retina. This will cause the person to\\nhave blurry vision. What the blur looks like will depend\\nupon the amount and the direction of the astigmatism. A\\nperson with nearsightedness (myopia) or farsightedness\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2384\\nAstigmatism\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 384'),\n",

A person\\nwith astigmatism may see the same dot as a blurred oval\\nor frankfurter-shaped blur.\\nSome cases of astigmatism are caused by problems\\nin the lens of the eye. Minor variations in the curvature of\\nthe lens can produce minor degrees of astigmatism\\n(lenticular astigmatism). In these patients, the cornea is\\nusually normal in shape. Infants, as a group, have the\\nleast amount of astigmatism. Astigmatism may increase\\nduring childhood, as the eye is developing.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe main symptom of astigmatism is blurring. Peo-\\nple can also experience headaches and eyestrain. Parents\\ncan notice that a child may have astigmatism when the\\nchild can see some part of a pattern or picture more clear-\\nly than others. For example, lines going across may seem\\nclearer than lines going up and down.\\nRegular astigmatism can be caused by the weight of\\nthe upper eyelid resting on the eyeball creating distortion,\\nsurgical incisions in the cornea, trauma or scarring to the\\ncornea, the presence of tumors in the eyelid, or a develop-\\nmental factor. Irregular astigmatism can be caused by scar-\\nring or keratoconus. Keratoconus is a condition in which\\nthe cornea thins and becomes cone shaped. It usually\\noccurs around puberty and is more common in women.\\nAlthough the causes of keratoconus are unknown, it may\\nbe hereditary or a result of chronic eye rubbing, as in peo-\\nple with allergies. The center of the cone may not be in\\nline with the center of the cornea. Diabetes can play a role\\nin the development of astigmatism. High blood sugar lev-\\nels can cause shape changes in the lens of the eye. This\\nprocess usually occurs slowly and, often, is only noticed\\nwhen the diabetic has started treatment to control their\\nblood sugar. The return to a more normal blood sugar\\nallows the lens to return to normal and this change is\\nsometimes noticed by the patient as farsightedness.\\nBecause of this, diabetics should wait until their blood\\nsugar is under control for at least one month to allow\\nvision to stabilize before being measured for eyeglasses.\\nDiagnosis\\nPatients seek treatment because of blurred vision. A\\nvariety of tests can be used to detect astigmatism during\\nthe eye exam. The patient may be asked to describe the\\nastigmatic dial, a series of lines that radiate outward from\\na center. People with astigmatism will see some of the\\nlines more clearly than others. One diagnostic instrument\\nused is the keratometer. This measures the curvature of\\nthe central cornea. It measures the amount and direction\\nof the curvature. A corneal topographer can measure a\\nlarger area of the cornea. It can measure the central area\\nand mid-periphery of the cornea. A keratoscope projects\\na series of concentric light rings onto the cornea. Mis-\\nshapen areas of the cornea are revealed by noting areas\\nof the light pattern that do not appear concentric on the\\ncornea. Because these instruments are measuring the\\ncornea, it is also important to have a refraction in case the\\nlens is also contributing to the astigmatism. The refrac-\\ntion measures the optics or visual status of the eye and\\nthe result is the eyeglass prescription. The refraction is\\nwhen the patient is looking at an eye chart and the doctor\\nis putting different lenses in front of the patient’s eyes\\nand asks which one looks better.\\nTreatment\\nAstigmatism can be treated by the use of cylindrical\\nlenses. They can be in eyeglasses or contact lenses. The\\nunit of measure describing the power of the lens system or\\nlens is called the diopter (D). The lenses are shaped to\\ncounteract the shape of the sections of cornea that are caus-\\ning the difficulty. Because the correction is in one direction,\\nit is written in terms of the axis the correction is in. On a\\nprescription, for example, it may say -1.00D /H11003180°.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 385\\nAstigmatism\\nCornea\\nLens\\nLight\\nRetina\\nHorizontal line out of focus\\nAstigmatism corrected by lens\\nLight\\nAstigmatism can be treated by the use of cylindrical lenses.\\nThe lenses are shaped to counteract the shape of the sec-\\ntions of the cornea that are causing the difficulty.(Illustration\\nby Electronic Illustrators Group.)\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 385'),\n",

A-T also affects the immune system and increases the\\nrisk of leukemia and lymphoma in affected individuals.\\nDescription\\nThe disorder first appeared in the medical literature in\\nthe mid-1920s, but was not named specifically until 1957.\\nThe name is a combination of two recognized abnormali-\\nties: ataxia (lack of muscle control) and telangiectasia\\n(abnormal dilatation of capillary vessels that often result in\\ntumors and red skin lesions). However, A-T involves more\\nthan just the sum of these two findings. Other associated\\nA-T problems include immune system deficiencies,\\nextreme sensitivity to radiation, and blood cancers.\\nMedical researchers initially suspected that multiple\\ngenes (the units responsible for inherited features) were\\ninvolved. However, in 1995, mutations in a single large\\ngene were identified as causing A-T. Researchers named\\nthe gene ATM for A-T, mutated. Subsequent research\\nrevealed that ATM has a significant role in regulating cell\\ndivision. The symptoms associated with A-T reflect the\\nmain role of the AT gene, which is to induce several cellu-\\nlar responses to DNA damage, such as preventing damaged\\nDNA from being reproduced. When the AT gene is mutated\\ninto ATM, the signaling networks are affected and the cell\\nno longer responds correctly to minimize the damage.\\nA-T is very rare, but it occurs in every population\\nworld wide, with an estimated frequency of between\\n1/40,000 and 1/100,000 live births. But it is believed that\\nmany A-T cases, particularly those who die at a young\\nage, are never properly diagnosed. Therefore, this disease\\nmay actually be much more prevalent. According to the\\nA-T Project Foundation, an estimated 1% (2.5 million in\\nthe United States) of the general population carries defec-\\ntive A-T genes. Carriers of one copy of this gene do not\\ndevelop A-T, but have a significantly increased risk of\\ncancer. This makes the A-T gene one of the most impor-\\ntant cancer-related genes identified to date.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe ATM gene is autosomal recessive, meaning the\\ndisease occurs only if a defective gene is inherited from\\nboth parents. Infants with A-T initially often appear very\\nhealthy. At around age two, ataxia and nervous system\\nabnormalities becomes apparent. The root cause of A-T-\\nassociated ataxia is cell death in the brain, specifically\\nthe large branching cells of the nervous system (Purkin-\\nje’s cells) which are located in the cerebellum. A toddler\\nbecomes clumsy, loses balance easily and lacks muscle\\ncontrol. Speech becomes slurred and more difficult, and\\nthe symptoms progressively worsen. Between ages two\\nand eight, telangiectases, or tiny, red “spider” veins,\\nappear on the cheeks and ears and in the eyes.\\nBy age 10-12, children with A-T can no longer control\\ntheir muscles. Immune system deficiencies become com-\\nmon, and affected individuals are extremely sensitive to\\nradiation. Immune system deficiencies vary between indi-\\nviduals but include lower-than-normal levels of proteins\\nthat function as antibodies (immunoglobulins) and white\\nblood cells (blood cells not containing “iron” proteins). The\\nthymus gland, which aids in development of the body’s\\nimmune system, is either missing or has developed abnor-\\nmally. Intelligence is normal, but growth may be retarded\\nowing to immune system or hormonal deficiencies. Indi-\\nviduals with A-T are also sometimes afflicted with dia-\\nbetes, prematurely graying hair, and difficulty swallowing.\\nAs the children grow older, the immune system becomes\\nweaker and less capable of fighting infection. In the later\\nstages, recurrent respiratory infections and blood cancers,\\nsuch as leukemia or lymphoma, are common.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis relies on recognizing the hallmarks of A-\\nT: progressive ataxia and telangiectasia. However, this\\nmay be difficult as ataxia symptoms do appear prior to\\ntelangiectasia symptoms by several years. Other symp-\\ntoms can vary between individuals; for example, 70% of\\nindividuals with A-T have a high incidence of respiratory\\ninfection, 30% do not. The identification of the ATM\\ngene raises hopes that screening, and perhaps treatment,\\nmay be possible.\\nTreatment\\nThere is currently no cure for A-T, and treatment\\nfocuses on managing the individual’s multiple symp-\\ntoms. Physical therapy and speech therapy can help the\\npatient adjust to ataxia. Injections of gamma globulin, or\\nextracts of human blood that contain antibodies, are used\\nto strengthen the weakened immune system. High-dose\\nvitamin administrations may also be prescribed.\\nResearch continues in many countries to find effective\\ntreatments. Individuals and families living with this dis-\\norder may benefit from attending support groups.\\nPrognosis\\nA-T is a fatal condition. Children with A-T become\\nphysically disabled by their early teens and typically die\\nby their early 20s, usually from the associated blood can-\\ncers and malignancies.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 403}, page_content='Description\\nAtelectasis can result from an obstruction (block-\\nage) of the airways that affects tiny air scas called alve-\\noli. Alveoli are very thin-walled and contain a rich blood\\nsupply. They are important for lung function, since their\\npurpose is the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide.\\nWhen the airways are blocked by a mucous “plug,” for-\\neign object, or tumor, the alveoli are unable to fill with\\nair and collapse of lung tissue can occur in the affected\\narea. Atelectasis is a potential complication following\\nsurgery, especially in individuals who have undergone\\nchest or abdominal operations resulting in associated\\nabdominal or chest pain during breathing. Congenital\\natelectasis can result from a failure of the lungs to\\nexpand at birth. This congenital condition may be local-\\nized or may affect all of both lungs.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses of atelectasis include insufficient attemps at\\nrespiration by the newborn, bronchial obstruction, or\\nabsence of surfactant (a substance secreted by alveoli\\nthat maintains the stability of lung tissue by reducing the\\nsurface tension of fluids that coat the lung). This lack of\\nsurfactant reduces the surface area available for effective\\ngas exchange causing it to collapse if severe. Pressure on\\nthe lung from fluid or air can cause atelectasis as well as\\nobstruction of lung air passages by thick mucus resulting\\nfrom various infections and lung diseases. Tumors and\\ninhaled objects can also cause obstruction of the airway,\\nleading to atelectasis.\\nAnyone undergoing chest or abdominal surgery\\nusing general anesthesia is at risk to develop atelectasis,\\nsince breathing is often shallow after surgery to avoid\\npain from the surgical incision. Any significant decrease\\nin airflow to the alveoli contributes to pooling of secre-\\ntions, which in turn can cause infection. Chest injuries\\ncausing shallow breathing, including fractured ribs, can\\ncause atelectasis. Common symptoms of atelectasis\\ninclude shortness of breath and decreased chest wall\\nexpansion. If atelectasis only afects a small area of the\\nlung, symptoms are ususally minimal. If the condition\\naffects a large area of the lung and develops quickly, the\\nindividual may turn blue (cyanotic) or pale, have extreme\\nshortness of breath, and feel a stabbing pain on the\\naffected side. Fever and increased heart rate may be pre-\\nsent if infection accompanies atelectasis.\\nDiagnosis\\nTo diagnose atelectasis, a doctor starts by recording\\nthe patient’s symptoms and performing a thorough phys-\\nical examination . When the doctor listens to the lungs\\nthrough a stethoscope (ausculation), diminished or\\nbronchial breath sounds may be heard. By tapping on the\\nchest (percussion) while listening through the stetho-\\nscope, the doctor can often tell if the lung is collapsed. A\\nchest x raythat shows an airless area in the lung con-\\nfirms the diagnosis of atelectasis. If an obstruction of the\\nairways is suspected, a computed tomography scan (CT)\\nor bronchoscopy may be performed to locate the cause\\nof the blockage.\\nTreatment\\nIf atelectasis is due to obstruction of the airway, the\\nfirst step in treatment is to remove the cause of the block-\\nage. This may be done by coughing, suctioning, or bron-\\nchoscopy. If a tumor is the cause of atelectasis, surgery\\nmay be necessary to remove it. Antibiotics are commonly\\nused to fight the infection that often accompanies atelec-\\ntasis. In cases where recurrent or long-lasting infection is\\ndisabling or where significant bleeding occurs, the affect-\\ned section of the lung may be surgically removed.\\nPrognosis\\nIf atelectasis is caused by a thick mucus “plug” or\\ninhaled foreign object, the patient usually recovers com-\\npletely when the blockage is removed. If it is caused by a\\ntumor, the outcome depends on the nature of the tumor\\ninvolved. If atelectasis is a result of surgery, other post-oper-\\native conditions and/or complications affect the prognosis.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2390\\nAtelectasis\\nA computed tomography (CT) scan through a patient’s\\nchest.The collapsed lung appears at the right of the image.\\n(Photo Researchers, Inc.

In Greek,athere means gruel,\\nand skleros means hard. Atherosclerosis is often called\\narteriosclerosis. Arteriosclerosis (from the Greek arteria,\\nmeaning artery) is a general term for hardening of the\\narteries. Arteriosclerosis can occur in several forms,\\nincluding atherosclerosis.\\nDescription\\nAtherosclerosis, a progressive process responsible\\nfor most heart disease, is a type of arteriosclerosis or\\nhardening of the arteries. An artery is made up of several\\nlayers: an inner lining called the endothelium, an elastic\\nmembrane that allows the artery to expand and contract,\\na layer of smooth muscle, and a layer of connective tis-\\nsue. Arteriosclerosis is a broad term that includes a hard-\\nening of the inner and middle layers of the artery. It can\\nbe caused by normal aging, by high blood pressure, and\\nby diseases such as diabetes. Atherosclerosis is a type of\\narteriosclerosis that affects only the inner lining of an\\nartery. It is characterized by plaque deposits that block\\nthe flow of blood.\\nPlaque is made of fatty substances, cholesterol,\\nwaste products from the cells, calcium, and fibrin, a\\nstringy material that helps clot blood. The plaque forma-\\ntion process stimulates the cells of the artery wall to pro-\\nduce substances that accumulate in the inner layer. Fat\\nbuilds up within these cells and around them, and they\\nform connective tissue and calcium. The inner layer of\\nthe artery wall thickens, the artery’s diameter is reduced,\\nand blood flow and oxygen delivery are decreased.\\nPlaques can rupture or crack open, causing the sudden\\nformation of a blood clot (thrombosis).

It can cause a\\nstrokeif it completely blocks the brain (carotid) arteries.\\nAtherosclerosis can also occur in the arteries of the neck,\\nkidneys, thighs, and arms, causing kidney failure or gan-\\ngrene and amputation.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAtherosclerosis can begin in the late teens, but it\\nusually takes decades to cause symptoms. Some people\\nexperience rapidly progressing atherosclerosis during\\ntheir thirties, others during their fifties or sixties. Athero-\\nsclerosis is complex. Its exact cause is still unknown. It is\\nthought that atherosclerosis is caused by a response to\\ndamage to the endothelium from high cholesterol , high\\nblood pressure, and cigarette smoking. A person who has\\nall three of these risk factors is eight times more likely to\\ndevelop atherosclerosis than is a person who has none.\\nPhysical inactivity, diabetes, and obesity are also risk\\nfactors for atherosclerosis. High levels of the amino acid\\nhomocysteine and abnormal levels of protein-coated fats\\ncalled lipoproteins also raise the risk of coronary artery\\ndisease. These substances are the targets of much current\\nresearch. The role of triglycerides, another fat that circu-\\nlates in the blood, in forming atherosclerotic plaques is\\nunclear. High levels of triglycerides are often associated\\nwith diabetes, obesity, and low levels of high-density\\nlipoproteins (HDL cholesterol). The more HDL (“good”)\\ncholesterol, in the blood, the less likely is coronary artery\\ndisease. These risk factors are all modifiable. Non-modi-\\nfiable risk factors are heredity, sex, and age.\\nRisk factors that can be changed:\\n• Cigarette/tobacco smoke—Smoking increases both the\\nchance of developing atherosclerosis and the chance of\\ndying from coronary heart disease. Second hand smoke\\nmay also increase risk.\\n• High blood cholesterol—Cholesterol, a soft, waxy sub-\\nstance, comes from foods such as meat, eggs, and other\\nanimal products and is produced in the liver. Age, sex,\\nheredity, and diet affect cholesterol. Total blood choles-\\nterol is considered high at levels above 240 mg/dL and\\nborderline at 200-239 mg/dL. High-risk levels of low-\\ndensity lipoprotein (LDL cholesterol) begin at 130-159\\nmg/dL.\\n• High triglycerides—Most fat in food and in the body\\ntakes the form of triglycerides. Blood triglyceride lev-\\nels above 400 mg/dL have been linked to coronary\\nartery disease in some people. Triglycerides, however,\\nare not nearly as harmful as LDL cholesterol.\\n• High blood pressure—Blood pressure of 140 over 90 or\\nhigher makes the heart work harder, and over time, both\\nweakens the heart and harms the arteries.\\n• Physical inactivity—Lack of exercise increases the risk\\nof atherosclerosis.\\n• Diabetes mellitus—The risk of developing atheroscle-\\nrosis is seriously increased for diabetics and can be\\nlowered by keeping diabetes under control. Most dia-\\nbetics die from heart attacks caused by atherosclerosis.\\n• Obesity—Excess weight increases the strain on the\\nheart and increases the risk of developing atherosclero-\\nsis even if no other risk factors are present.\\nRisk factors that cannot be changed:\\n• Heredity—People whose parents have coronary artery\\ndisease, atherosclerosis, or stroke at an early age are at\\nincreased risk. The high rate of severe hypertension\\namong African-Americans puts them at increased risk.\\n• Sex—Before age 60, men are more likely to have heart\\nattacks than women are. After age 60, the risk is equal\\namong men and women.\\n• Age—Risk is higher in men who are 45 years of age and\\nolder and women who are 55 years of age and older.\\nSymptoms differ depending upon the location of the\\natherosclerosis.\\n• In the coronary (heart) arteries: Chest pain, heart attack,\\nor sudden death.\\n• In the carotid (brain) arteries: Sudden dizziness, weak-\\nness, loss of speech, or blindness.\\n• In the femoral (leg) arteries: Disease of the blood ves-\\nsels in the outer parts of the body (peripheral vascular\\ndisease ) causes cramping and fatigue in the calves\\nwhen walking.\\n• In the renal (kidney) arteries: High blood pressure that\\nis difficult to treat.\\nDiagnosis\\nPhysicians may be able to make a diagnosis of athero-\\nsclerosis during a physical exam by means of a stetho-\\nscope and gentle probing of the arteries with the hand (pal-\\npation).

Herbal\\ntherapies that may be helpful include: hawthorn (Cratae-\\ngus laevigata ), notoginseng root ( Panax notoginseng ),\\ngarlic (Allium sativum), ginger (Zingiber officinale), hot\\nred or chili peppers, yarrow ( Achillea millefolium ), and\\nalfalfa ( Medicago sativum ). Relaxation techniques\\nincluding yoga, meditation , guided imagery , biofeed-\\nback, and counseling and other “talking” therapies may\\nalso be useful to prevent or slow the progress of the dis-\\nease. Dietary modifications focus on eating foods that are\\nlow in fats (especially saturated fats), cholesterol, sugar,\\nand animal proteins and high in fiber and antioxidants\\n(found in fresh fruits and vegetables). Liberal use of\\nonions and garlic is recommended, as is eating raw and\\ncooked fish, especially cold-water fish like salmon.\\nSmoking, alcohol, and stimulants like coffee should be\\navoided. Chelation therapy , which uses anticoagulant\\ndrugs and nutrients to dissolve plaque and flush it through\\nthe kidneys, is controversial. Long-term remedies can be\\nprescribed by specialists in ayurvedic medicine , which\\ncombines diet, herbal remedies, relaxation and exercise,\\nand homeopathy, which treats a disease with small doses\\nof a drug that causes the symptoms of the disease.\\nPrognosis\\nAtherosclerosis can be successfully treated but not\\ncured. Recent clinical studies have shown that athero-\\nsclerosis can be delayed, stopped, and even reversed by\\naggressively lowering LDL cholesterol. New diagnostic\\ntechniques enable physicians to identify and treat athero-\\nsclerosis in its earliest stages. New technologies and sur-\\ngical procedures have extended the lives of many patients\\nwho would otherwise have died.

It includes a variety of\\nfoods that are low in fat and cholesterol and high in\\nfiber; plenty of fruits and vegetables; and limited sodi-\\num. Fat should comprise no more than 30%, and saturat-\\ned fat no more than 8-10%, of total daily calories\\naccording to the American Heart Association. Choles-\\nterol should be limited to about 300 milligrams per day\\nand sodium to about 2,400 milligrams. The “Food\\nGuide” Pyramid developed by the U.S. Departments of\\nAgriculture and Health and Human Services provides\\ndaily guidelines: 6-11 servings of bread, cereal, rice, and\\npasta; 3-5 servings of vegetables; 2-4 servings of fruit;\\n2-3 servings of milk, yogurt, and cheese; and 2-3 serv-\\nings of meat, poultry, fish, dry beans, eggs, and nuts.\\nFats, oils, and sweets should be used sparingly. Mono-\\nunsaturated oils, like olive and rapeseed (Canola) are\\ngood alternatives to use for cooking.\\n• Exercise regularly—Aerobic exercise can lower blood\\npressure, help control weight, and increase HDL\\n(“good”) cholesterol. It may keep the blood vessels\\nmore flexible. Moderate to intense aerobic exercise\\nlasting about 30 minutes (or three 10-minute exercise\\nperiods) four or more times per week is recommended,\\naccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-\\nvention and the American College of Sports Medicine.\\nAerobic exercise includes walking, jogging, and\\ncycling, active gardening, climbing stairs, or brisk\\nhousework. A physician should be consulted before\\nexercise if a person has atherosclerosis or is at\\nincreased risk for it.\\n• Maintain a desirable body weight—Losing weight can\\nhelp reduce total and LDL cholesterol, reduce triglyc-\\nerides, and boost HDL cholesterol. It may also reduce\\nblood pressure. Eating right and exercising are two key\\ncomponents in maintaining a desirable body weight.\\n• Do not smoke or use tobacco—Smoking has many\\nadverse effects on the heart but quitting can repair\\ndamage. Ex-smokers face the same risk of heart dis-\\nease as non-smokers within five to 10 years of quitting.\\nSmoking is the worst thing a person can do to their\\nheart and lungs.\\n• Seek treatment for hypertension—High blood pressure\\ncan be controlled through lifestyle changes—reducing\\nsodium and fat, exercising, managing stress, quitting\\nKEY TERMS\\nArteriosclerosis —Hardening of the arteries. It\\nincludes atherosclerosis, but the two terms are\\noften used synonymously.\\nCholesterol—A fat-like substance that is made by\\nthe human body and eaten in animal products.\\nCholesterol is used to form cell membranes and\\nprocess hormones and vitamin D. High choles-\\nterol levels contribute to the development of ath-\\nerosclerosis.\\nHDL Cholesterol —About one-third or one-fourth\\nof all cholesterol is high-density lipoprotein cho-\\nlesterol. High levels of HDL, nicknamed “good”\\ncholesterol, decrease the risk of atherosclerosis.\\nLDL Cholesterol—Low-density lipoprotein choles-\\nterol is the primary cholesterol molecule.

Athlete’s foot (also known as tinea pedis or\\nfoot ringworm ) can be treated, but it can be tenacious\\nand difficult to clear up completely.\\nDescription\\nAthlete’s foot is a very common condition of itchy,\\npeeling skin on the feet. In fact, it’s so common that most\\npeople will have at least one episode at least once in their\\nlives. It’s less often found in women and children under\\nage 12. (Symptoms that look like athlete’s foot in young\\nchildren most probably are caused by some other skin\\ncondition).\\nBecause the fungi grow well in warm, damp areas,\\nthey flourish in and around swimming pools, showers,\\nand locker rooms. Tinea pedis got its common name\\nbecause the infection was common among athletes who\\noften used these areas.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAthlete’s foot is caused by a fungal infection that\\nmost often affects the fourth and fifth toe webs. Trichophy-\\nton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, and Epidermophyton floc-\\ncosum, the fungi that cause athlete’s foot, are unusual in\\nthat they live exclusively on dead body tissue (hair, the\\nouter layer of skin, and nails). The fungus grows best in\\nmoist, damp, dark places with poor ventilation. The prob-\\nlem doesn’t occur among people who usually go barefoot.\\nMany people carry the fungus on their skin. Howev-\\ner, it will only flourish to the point of causing athlete’s\\nfoot if conditions are right. Many people believe athlete’s\\nfoot is highly contagious, especially in public swimming\\npools and shower rooms. Research has shown, however,\\nthat it is difficult to pick up the infection simply by walk-\\ning barefoot over a contaminated damp floor. Exactly\\nwhy some people develop the condition and others don’t\\nis not well understood.\\nSweaty feet, tight shoes, synthetic socks that don’t\\nabsorb moisture well, a warm climate, and not drying the\\nfeet well after swimming or bathing, all contribute to the\\novergrowth of the fungus.\\nSymptoms of athlete’s foot include itchy, sore skin\\non the toes, with scaling, cracking, inflammation, and\\nblisters. Blisters that break, exposing raw patches of tis-\\nsue, can cause pain and swelling. As the infection\\nspreads, itching and burning may get worse.\\nIf it’s not treated, athlete’s foot can spread to the\\nsoles of the feet and toenails. Stubborn toenail infections\\nmay appear at the same time, with crumbling, scaling and\\nthickened nails, and nail loss. The infection can spread\\nfurther if patients scratch and then touch themselves else-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2398\\nAthlete’s foot\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 398'),\n",

It’s also\\npossible to spread the infection to other parts of the body\\nvia contaminated bed sheets or clothing.\\nDiagnosis\\nNot all foot rashes are athlete’s foot, which is why a\\nphysician should diagnose the condition before any\\nremedies are used. Using nonprescription products on a\\nrash that is not athlete’s foot could make the rash worse.\\nA dermatologist can diagnose the condition by\\nphysical examination and by examining a preparation\\nof skin scrapings under a microscope. This test, called a\\nKOH preparation, treats a sample of tissue scraped from\\nthe infected area with heat and potassium hydroxide\\n(KOH). This treatment dissolves certain substances in\\nthe tissue sample, making it possible to see the fungi\\nunder the microscope.\\nTreatment\\nAthlete’s foot may be resistant to medication and\\nshould not be ignored. Simple cases usually respond well\\nto antifungal creams or sprays (clotrimazole, ketocona-\\nzole, miconazole nitrate, sulconazole nitrate, or tolnaf-\\ntate). If the infection is resistant to topical treatment, the\\ndoctor may prescribe an oral antifungal drug.\\nUntreated athlete’s foot may lead to a secondary\\nbacterial infection in the skin cracks.\\nAlternative treatment\\nA footbath containing cinnamon has been shown to\\nslow down the growth of certain molds and fungi, and is\\nsaid to be very effective in clearing up athlete’s foot. To\\nmake the bath:\\n• heat four cups of water to a boil\\n• add eight to 10 broken cinnamon sticks\\n• reduce heat and simmer five minutes\\n• remove and let the mixture steep for 45 minutes until\\nlukewarm\\n• soak feet\\nOther herbal remedies used externally to treat ath-\\nlete’s foot include: a foot soak or powder containing\\ngoldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis); tea tree oil (Melaleu-\\nca spp.); or calendula ( Calendula officinalis ) cream to\\nhelp heal cracked skin.\\nPrognosis\\nAthlete’s foot usually responds well to treatment,\\nbut it is important to take all medication as directed by a\\ndermatologist, even if the skin appears to be free of fun-\\ngus. Otherwise, the infection could return. The toenail\\ninfections that may accompany athlete’s foot, however,\\nare typically very hard to treat effectively\\nPrevention\\nGood personal hygiene and a few simple precautions\\ncan help prevent athlete’s foot.

Turkington\\nAthletic heart syndrome\\nDefinition\\nAthletic heart syndrome is the adaptation of an ath-\\nlete’s heart in response the physiologic stresses of strenu-\\nous physical training. It can be difficult to distinguish a\\nsignificant medical condition from an athletic heart.\\nDescription\\nThe heart adapts to physical demands by enlarging,\\nespecially the left ventricle. Enlargement increases the\\ncardiac output, the amount of blood pumped with each\\nbeat of the heart. The exact type of adaptation depends\\non the nature of the physical demand. There are two\\ntypes of demand, static and dynamic. Static demand\\ninvolves smaller groups of muscles under extreme resis-\\ntance for brief period. An example is weight lifting.\\nDynamic training involves larger groups of muscles at\\nlower resistance for extended periods of time. Examples\\nare aerobic training and tennis. Cardiac enlargement is\\nassociated with dynamic training. The heart’s response to\\nstatic training is hypertrophy, thickening of the muscle\\nwalls of the heart. As the wall of the heart adapts, there\\nare changes in the electrical conducting system of the\\nheart. Because of the larger volume of blood being\\npumped with each heart beat, the heart rate when at rest\\ndecreases below the normal level for nonathletes.\\nSudden unexpected death (SUD) is the death of an\\nathlete, usually during or shortly after physical activity.\\nOften, there is no warning that the person will experience\\nSUD, although in some cases, warning signs appear\\nwhich cause the person to seek medical advice. Impor-\\ntantly, cases of death occurring during physical activity\\nare not caused by athletic heart syndrome, but by undiag-\\nnosed heart disorders.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAthletic heart syndrome is the consequence of a nor-\\nmal adaptation by the heart to increased physical activity.\\nThe changes in the electrical conduction system of the\\nheart may be pronounced and diagnostic, but should not\\ncause problems. In the case of SUD, other heart prob-\\nlems are involved. In 85-97% of the cases of SUD, an\\nunderlying structural defect of the heart has been noted.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe changes in the heart beat caused by the electri-\\ncal conduction system of the heart are detectable on an\\nelectrocardiogram. Many of the changes seen in athletic\\nheart syndrome mimic those of various heart diseases.\\nCareful examination must be made to distinguish heart\\ndisease from athletic heart syndrome.\\nPrognosis\\nThe yearly rate for occurrence of SUD in people less\\nthan 35 years of age is less than seven incidents per\\n100,000. Of all SUD cases, only about 8% are exercise\\nrelated. On a national basis, this means that each year\\napproximately 25 athletes experience SUD. In persons\\nover age 35, the incidence of SUD is approximately 55 in\\n100,000, with only 3% of the cases occurring during\\nexercise.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nAlexander, R. W., R. C. Schlant, and V .

Drastically reducing the amount of car-\\nbohydrate intake causes liver and muscle glycogen loss,\\nwhich has a strong but temporary diuretic effect. Long-\\nterm weight loss occurs because with a low amount of\\ncarbohydrate intake, the body burns stored fat for energy.\\nThe four-step diet starts with a two-week induction\\nprogram designed to rebalance an individual’s metabo-\\nlism. Unlimited amounts of fat and protein are allowed\\nbut carbohydrate intake is restricted to 15-20 grams per\\nday. Foods allowed include butter, oil, meat, poultry, fish,\\neggs, cheese, and cream. The daily amount of carbohy-\\ndrates allowed equals about three cups of salad vegeta-\\nbles, such as lettuce, cucumbers, and celery.\\nThe second stage is for ongoing weight loss. It\\nallows 15-40 grams of carbohydrates a day. When the\\nindividual is about 10 pounds from their desired weight,\\nthey begin the pre-maintenance phase. This gradually\\nadds one to three servings a week of high carbohydrate\\nfoods, such as a piece of fruit or slice of whole-wheat\\nbread. When the desired weight is reached, the mainte-\\nnance stage begins. It allows 40-60 grams of carbohy-\\ndrates per day.\\nOpinion from the general medical community\\nremains mixed on the Atkins diet, but is generally unfa-\\nvorable. There have been no significant long-term scien-\\ntific studies on the diet. A number of leading medical and\\nhealth organizations, including the American Medical\\nAssociation, American Dietetic Association (ADA), and\\nthe American Heart Association oppose it. It is drastical-\\nly different than the dietary intakes recommended by the\\nU.S. Department of Agriculture and the National Insti-\\ntutes of Health. Much of the opposition is because the\\ndiet is lacking in some vitamins and nutrients, and\\nbecause it is high in fat. In a hearing before the U.S. Con-\\ngress on February 24, 2000, an ADA representative\\ncalled the Atkins diet “hazardous” and said it lacked sci-\\nentific credibility.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 401\\nAtkins diet\\nDR. ROBERT C. ATKINS (1930– )\\nDr. Robert C. Atkins graduated from the University\\nof Michigan in 1951 and received his medical degree\\nfrom Cornell University Medical School in 1955 with a\\nspecialty in cardiology. As an internist and cardiologist\\nhe developed the Atkins Diet in the early 1970s. The diet\\nis a ketogenic diet—a high protein, high fat, and very\\nlow carbohydrate regimen resulting in ketosis. It empha-\\nsizes meat, cheese, and eggs, while discouraging foods\\nsuch as bread, pasta, fruit, and sugar. It first came to pub-\\nlic attention in 1972 with the publication of Dr. Atkins’\\nDiet Revolution . The book quickly became a bestseller\\nbut unlike most other fad diet books, this one has\\nremained popular. At last count, it had been reprinted 28\\ntimes and sold more than 10 million copies worldwide.\\nSince then, Atkins has authored a number of other books\\non his diet theme, including Dr. Atkins’ New Diet Revo-\\nlution (1992), Dr. Atkins’ Quick and Easy New Diet\\nCookbook (1997), and The Vita-Nutrient Solution:\\nNature’s Answer to Drugs(1998).\\nAtkins has seen about 60,000 patients in his more\\nthan 30 years of practice. He has also appeared on numer-\\nous radio and television talk shows, has his own syndicat-\\ned radio program, Your Health Choices , and authors the\\nmonthly newsletter Dr. Atkins’ Health Revelations. Atkins\\nhas received the World Organization of Alternative Medi-\\ncine’s Recognition of Achievement Award and been\\nnamed the National Health Federation’s Man of the Year.\\nHe is director of the Atkins Center for Complementary\\nMedicine which he founded in the early 1980s.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 415}, page_content='Preparations\\nNo advance preparation is needed to go on the diet.\\nHowever, as with most diets, it is generally considered\\nappropriate to consult with a physician and to have a\\nphysical evaluation before starting such a nutritional reg-\\nimen. The evaluation should include blood tests to deter-\\nmine levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, insulin,\\nand uric acid. A glucose tolerance test is also recom-\\nmended.\\nPrecautions\\nAdherence to the Atkins diet can result in vitamin\\nand mineral deficiencies. In his books, Atkins recom-\\nmends a wide-range of nutritional supplements, includ-\\ning a multi-vitamin. Among his recommendations,\\nAtkins suggests the following daily dosages: 300-600\\nmicrograms (mcg) of chromium picolinate, 100-400 mil-\\nligrams (mg) of pantetheine, 200 mcg of selenium, and\\n450-675 mcg of biotin.\\nThe diet is not recommended for lacto-ovo vegetari-\\nans, since it cannot be done as successfully without pro-\\ntein derived from animal products. Also, vegans cannot\\nfollow this diet, since a vegan diet is too high in carbohy-\\ndrates, according to Atkins. Instead, he recommends veg-\\netarians with a serious weight problem give up vegetari-\\nanism, or at least include fish in their diet.\\nSide effects\\nAccording to Atkins, the diet causes no adverse side\\neffects. Many health care professionals disagree. In a fact\\nsheet for the Healthcare Reality Check Web site\\n(http://www.hcrc.org), Ellen Coleman, a registered dieti-\\ncian and author, said the diet may have serious side\\neffects for some people. She said complications associat-\\ned with the diet include ketosis,dehydration, electrolyte\\nloss, calcium depletion, weakness, nausea, and kidney\\nproblems. “It is certainly riskier for overweight individu-\\nals with medical problems such as heart disease,hyper-\\ntension, kidney disease, and diabetes than it is for over-\\nweight people with no health problems,” she said.\\nPeople with diabetes taking insulin are at risk of\\nbecoming hypoglycemic if they do not eat appropriate\\ncarbohydrates.

Wells\\nAtopic dermatitis\\nDefinition\\nEczema is a general term used to describe a variety\\nof conditions that cause an itchy, inflamed skin rash.\\nAtopic dermatitis , a form of eczema, is a non-conta-\\ngious disorder characterized by chronically inflamed\\nskin and sometimes intolerable itching.\\nDescription\\nAtopic dermatitis refers to a wide range of diseases\\nthat are often associated with stress and allergic disor-\\nders that involve the respiratory system, like asthma and\\nhay fever. Although atopic dermatitis can appear at any\\nage, it is most common in children and young adults.\\nSymptoms usually abate before the age of 25 and do not\\naffect the patient’s general health.\\nAbout one in ten babies develop a form of atopic\\ndermatitis called infantile eczema. Characterized by skin\\nthat oozes and becomes encrusted, infantile eczema most\\noften occurs on the face and scalp. The condition usually\\nimproves before the child’s second birthday, and medical\\nattention can keep symptoms in check until that time.\\nWhen atopic dermatitis develops after infancy,\\ninflammation, blistering, oozing, and crusting are less\\npronounced. The patient’s sores become dry, turn from\\nred to brownish-gray, and skin may thicken and become\\nscaly. In dark-skinned individuals, this condition can\\ncause the complexion to lighten or darken. Itching asso-\\nciated with this condition is usually worst at night. It can\\nbe so intense that patients scratch until their sores bleed,\\nsometimes causing scarring and infection.\\nAtopic dermatitis affects about 3% of the population\\nof the United States, and about 80% of the people who\\nhave the condition have one or more relatives with the\\nsame condition or a similar one. Symptoms tend to be\\nmost severe in females. Atopic dermatitis can erupt on\\nany part of the skin, and crusted, thickened patches on\\nthe fingers, palms, or the soles of the feet can last for\\nyears. In teenagers and young adults, atopic dermatitis\\noften appears on one or more of the following areas:\\n• elbow creases\\n• backs of the knees\\n• ankles\\n• wrists\\n• face\\n• neck\\n• upper chest\\n• palms and between the fingers\\nCauses and symptoms\\nWhile allergic reactions often trigger atopic dermati-\\ntis, the condition is thought to be the result of an inherit-\\ned over-active immune system or a genetic defect that\\ncauses the skin to lose abnormally large amounts of\\nmoisture. The condition can be aggravated by a cycle that\\ndevelops in which the skin itches, the patient scratches,\\nthe condition worsens, the itching worsens, the patient\\nscratches, etc. This cycle must be broken by relieving the\\nitching to allow the skin time to heal.

Atrial ectopic beats are also known as prema-\\nture atrial beats, premature atrial complex (PAC), or atri-\\nal extrasystole.\\nDescription\\nAn AEB is usually a harmless disturbance in the\\nnormal rhythm of the heart. It can occur only occasional-\\nly, in a regular pattern, or several may occur in sequence\\nand then disappear. Most often, the person is unaware of\\nthe event.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAs people age, extra beats tend to happen more fre-\\nquently even in perfectly healthy individuals. AEB may\\nbe triggered or increased by stress, caffeine, smoking,\\nand some medicines. Cold remedies containing ephedrine\\nor pseudoephedrine have been known to increase the inci-\\ndence of atrial ectopic beats. AEB may also be the result\\nof an enlarged atria, lung disease, or the result of reduced\\nblood supply to that area of the heart.\\nIf a person is aware of the event, the first symptom\\nof AEB is usually a feeling that the heart has skipped or\\nmissed a beat. This is often accompanied by a feeling\\nthat the heart is thumping or pounding in the chest. The\\nthumping or pounding is caused by the fact that when\\nthere is an AEB, the pause before the next beat is usually\\nlonger than normal. The next beat must be stronger than\\nusual to pump the accumulated blood out of the chamber.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of AEB is often suspected on the basis of\\nthe patient’s description of the occurrence. An electrocar-\\ndiogram (ECG) can confirm the diagnosis. An ECG\\nshows the heart beat as three wave forms. The first wave\\nis called P, the second is called QRS, and the last is T. An\\natrial ectopic beat will show up on the ECG as a P wave\\nthat occurs closer than usual to the preceding T wave.\\nTreatment\\nAtrial ectopic beats do not usually require treatment.\\nIf treatment is necessary because the beats occur fre-\\nquently and cause intolerable discomfort, the doctor may\\nprescribe medication.\\nPrognosis\\nOccasional AEB usually have no significance. If\\nthey increase in frequency, they can lead to atrial tachy-\\ncardia or fibrillation and to a decrease in cardiac output.\\nPrevention\\nAEB cannot usually be prevented. Aggravating fac-\\ntors can be addressed, like excessive stimulants, and\\nuncontrolled pulmonary disorders.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nMcGoon, Michael D., ed.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 420}, page_content='Atrial fibrillation and flutter\\nDefinition\\nAtrial fibrillation and flutter are abnormal heart\\nrhythms in which the atria, or upper chambers of the heart,\\nare out of sync with the ventricles, or lower chambers of\\nthe heart. In atrial fibrillation, the atria “quiver” chaotical-\\nly and the ventricles beat irregularly. In atrial flutter, the\\natria beat regularly and faster than the ventricles.\\nDescription\\nAtrial fibrillation and flutter are two types of cardiac\\narrhythmias, irregularities in the heart’s rhythm. Nearly\\n2 million Americans have atrial fibrillation, according to\\nthe American Heart Association. It is the most common\\nchronic arrhythmia. Atrial flutter is less common, but\\nboth of these arrhythmias can cause a blood clot to form\\nin the heart. This can lead to a stroke or a blockage car-\\nried by the blood flow (an embolism ) anywhere in the\\nbody’s arteries. Atrial fibrillation is responsible for about\\n15% of strokes.\\nThe atria are the heart’s two small upper chambers. In\\natrial fibrillation, the heart beat is completely irregular.\\nThe atrial muscles contract very quickly and irregularly;\\nthe ventricles, the heart’s two large lower chambers, beat\\nirregularly but not as fast as the atria. When the atria fibril-\\nlate, blood that is not completely pumped out can pool and\\nform a clot. In atrial flutter, the heart beat is usually very\\nfast but steady. The atria beat faster than the ventricles.\\nAtrial fibrillation often occurs in people with various\\ntypes of heart disease. Atrial fibrillation may also result\\nfrom an inflammation of the heart’s covering (pericardi-\\ntis), chest trauma or surgery, pulmonary disease, and cer-\\ntain medications. Atrial fibrillation is more common in\\nolder people; about 10% of people over the age of 75\\nhave it. Atrial flutter and fibrillation usually occur in peo-\\nple with hypertensive or coronary heart disease and other\\ntypes of heart disorders.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nIn most cases, the cause of atrial fibrillation and flut-\\nter can be found, but often it cannot. Causes of these\\nheart beat abnormalities include:\\n• many types of heart disease\\n• stress and anxiety\\n• caffeine\\n• alcohol\\n• tobacco\\n• diet pills\\n• some prescription and over-the-counter medications\\n• open heart surgery\\nSymptoms, when present, include:\\n• a fluttering feeling in the chest\\n• a pulse that feels like the heart is skipping, racing, jump-\\ning, or is irregular\\n• low energy\\n• a faint or dizzy feeling\\n• pressure or discomfort in the chest\\n• shortness of breath\\n• anxiety.\\nDiagnosis\\nA doctor can sometimes hear these arrhythmias\\nusing an instrument (a stethoscope) to listen to the\\nsounds within the chest. Atrial fibrillation and flutter are\\nusually diagnosed through electrocardiography\\n(EKGs), an exercisestress test , a 24-hour Holter EKG\\nmonitor, or a telephone cardiac monitor. An EKG shows\\nthe heart’s activity and may reveal a lack of oxygen\\n(ischemia). Electrodes covered with conducting jelly are\\nplaced on the patient’s chest, arms, and legs. The elec-\\ntrodes send impulses of the heart’s activity through a\\nmonitor (called an oscilloscope) to a recorder that traces\\nthe pattern of the impulses onto paper. The test takes\\nabout 10 minutes and is performed in a doctor’s office.\\nThe exercise stress test measures how the heart and blood\\nvessels respond to work when the patient is exercising on\\na treadmill or a stationary bike. This test is performed in\\na doctor’s office within an exercise laboratory and takes\\n15-30 minutes.\\nIn 24-hour EKG (Holter) monitoring, the patient\\nwears a small, portable tape recorder connected to disks\\non his/her chest that record the heart’s rhythm during\\nnormal activities. An EKG called transtelephonic moni-\\ntoring identifies arrhythmias that occur infrequently.\\nLike Holter monitoring , transtelephonic monitoring\\ncontinues for days or weeks and enables patients to send\\nthe EKG via telephone to a monitoring station when an\\narrhythmia is felt, or to store the information in the\\nrecorder and transmit it later. Doctors can also use high-\\nfrequency sound waves (echocardiography ) to deter-\\nmine the structure and function of the heart. This diag-\\nnostic method is often helpful to evaluate for underlying\\nheart disease.\\nTreatment\\nAtrial fibrillation and flutter are usually treated with\\nmedications and/or electrical shock ( cardioversion ).

Cardioversion, the elec-\\ntric shock to the chest wall, is usually performed emer-\\ngencies. This device briefly suspends the heart’s activity\\nand allows it to return to a normal rhythm.\\nAblation destroys the heart tissue that causes the\\narrhythmia. The tissue can be destroyed by catheteriza-\\ntion or surgery. Radiofrequency catheter ablation , per-\\nformed in a cardiac catheterization laboratory, can\\ncure atrial flutter and control the heart rate in atrial fib-\\nrillation. The patient is awake but sedated. A thin tube\\ncalled a catheter is inserted into a vein and is threaded\\ninto the heart. At the end of the catheter, a device maps\\nthe electrical pathways of the heart. A cardiologist, a\\ndoctor specializing in the heart, uses this map to identify\\nthe pathway(s) causing the arrhythmia, and then elimi-\\nnates it (them) with bursts of high-frequency radio\\nwaves. Surgical ablation is performed in an operating\\nroom under general anesthesia. Computerized mapping\\ntechniques are combined with a cold probe to destroy\\narrhythmia-causing tissue. Ablation is generally suc-\\ncessful. When ablation is used for atrial fibrillation, it is\\nusually followed by implantation of a pacemaker as well\\nas drug therapy.\\nA pacemaker is a battery-powered device about the\\nsize of a matchbox that is surgically implanted near the\\ncollarbone to regulate the heart beat. Lead wires thread-\\ned to the right side of the heart supply electrical energy\\nto pace the atria and ventricles. The implantable car-\\ndioverter defibrillator is a treatment for serious arrhyth-\\nmias. The battery-powered device senses an abnormal\\nheart rhythm and automatically provides electrical\\nshock(s). The shock(s) suspends heart activity and then\\nallows the heart to initiate a normal rhythm. Wire elec-\\ntrodes on the device are attached to the heart. Some of\\nthe electrodes are attached to the outside of the heart\\nand some are attached to the inside of the heart through\\nveins. The newest implantable cardioverter defibrilla-\\ntors can be implanted in the chest wall and do not\\nrequire open chest surgery. These devices weigh less\\nthan 10 oz and generally last seven or eight years. An\\nimplantable cardioverter defibrillator is usually used\\nwith drug therapy, but the amount medication is\\nreduced. In maze surgery, often the last resort, surgeons\\ncreate a maze of stitches (sutures) that help the heart’s\\nelectrical impulses travel effectively.\\nMost of the drugs used for treatment have poten-\\ntial side effects and should be carefully monitored by\\na doctor. The goal of treatment is to control the rate\\nand rhythm of the heart and to prevent the formation\\nof blood clots. If the arrhythmia is caused by heart\\ndisease, the heart disease will also be treated. The\\nAmerican Heart Association recommends aggressive\\ntreatment.\\nA digitalis drug, most commonly digoxin, is usually\\nprescribed to control the heart rate. Digitalis drugs slow\\nthe heart’s electrical impulses, helping to restore the nor-\\nmal rate and rhythm. These drugs also increase the abili-\\nty of the heart’s muscular layer to contract and pump\\nproperly. Beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers\\ncan also be used for this purpose. Beta-blockers slow the\\nspeed of electrical impulses through the heart. Some cal-\\ncium channel blockers dampen the heart’s response to\\nerratic electrical impulses.\\nTo prevent blood clots, aspirin or warfarin\\n(Coumadin) is administered. Warfarin, however, has\\npotential bleeding side effects, especially in older\\npatients. Amiodarone is fairly efffective for atrial flutter.\\nThis drug is often able to maintain the heart’s proper\\nrhythm and can also help control the heart rate when the\\nflutter occurs.\\nPrognosis\\nPatients with atrial fibrillation and flutter can live a\\nnormal life for many years as long as the arrhythmia is\\ncontrolled and serious blood clots are prevented.\\nPrevention\\nAtrial fibrillation and flutter can sometimes be pre-\\nvented when the cause can be identified and controlled.\\nDepending on the cause, prevention could include:\\n• treating the underlying heart disease\\n• reducing stress and anxiety\\n• reducing or stopping consumption of caffeine, alcohol,\\nor tobacco; and/or\\n• discontinuing diet pills or other medications (over-the-\\ncounter or prescription)\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nCurrent Medical Diagnosis and Treatment, 1998.37th ed.

Normally,\\nthis opening closes before birth, but if it does not, the\\nchild is born with a hole between the left and right atria.\\nThis abnormal opening is called an atrial septal defect\\nand causes blood from the left atrium to flow into the\\nright atrium.\\nDifferent types of atrial septal defects can occur, and\\nthey are classified according to where in the separating\\nwall they are found. The most commonly found atrial\\nseptal defect occurs in the middle of the atrial septum\\nand accounts for about 70% of all atrial septal defects.\\nAbnormal openings can form in the upper and lower\\nparts of the atrial septum as well.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAbnormal openings in the atrial septum occur dur-\\ning fetal development and are twice as common in\\nfemales as in males. These abnormalities can go unno-\\nticed if the opening is small, producing no abnormal\\nsymptoms. If the defect is big, large amounts of blood\\nflowing from the left to the right atrium will cause the\\nright atrium to swell to hold the extra blood.\\nPeople born with an atrial septal defect can have no\\nsymptoms through their twenties, but by age 40, most\\npeople with this condition have symptoms that can\\ninclude shortness of breath , rapid abnormal beating of\\nthe atria (atrial fibrillation), and eventually heart failure.\\nDiagnosis\\nAtrial septal defects can be identified by various\\nmethods. Abnormal changes in the sound of the heart\\nbeats can be heard when a doctor listens to the heart with\\na stethoscope. In addition, a chest x ray , an electrocar-\\ndiogram (ECG, an electrical printout of the heartbeats),\\nand an echocardiogram (a test that uses sound waves to\\nform a detailed image of the heart) can also be used to\\nidentify this condition.\\nAn atrial septal defect can also be diagnosed by using\\na test called cardiac catheterization .

Their clumsiness may\\nextend to the social arena, where they are sometimes\\nshunned due to their impulsive and intrusive behavior.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe causes of ADHD are not known. However, it\\nappears that heredity plays a major role in the develop-\\nment of ADHD. Children with an ADHD parent or sib-\\nling are more likely to develop the disorder themselves.\\nBefore birth, ADHD children may have been exposed to\\npoor maternal nutrition , viral infections, or maternal\\nsubstance abuse. In early childhood, exposure to lead or\\nother toxins can cause ADHD-like symptoms. Traumatic\\nbrain injury or neurological disorders may also trigger\\nADHD symptoms. Although the exact cause of ADHD is\\nnot known, an imbalance of certain neurotransmitters,\\nthe chemicals in the brain that transmit messages\\nbetween nerve cells, is believed to be the mechanism\\nbehind ADHD symptoms.\\nA widely publicized study conducted by Dr. Ben\\nFeingold in the early 1970s suggested that allergies to\\ncertain foods and food additives caused the characteristic\\nhyperactivity of ADHD children. Although some chil-\\ndren may have adverse reactions to certain foods that can\\naffect their behavior (for example, a rash might tem-\\nporarily cause a child to be distracted from other tasks),\\ncarefully controlled follow-up studies have uncovered no\\nlink between food allergies and ADHD. Another popular-\\nly held misconception about food and ADHD is that the\\nconsumption of sugar causes hyperactive behavior.\\nAgain, studies have shown no link between sugar intake\\nand ADHD. It is important to note, however, that a nutri-\\ntionally balanced diet is important for normal develop-\\nment in all children.\\nPsychologists and other mental health professionals\\ntypically use the criteria listed in the Diagnostic and Sta-\\ntistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition\\n(DSM-IV)as a guideline for determining the presence of\\nADHD. For a diagnosis of ADHD, DSM-IV requires the\\npresence of at least six of the following symptoms of\\ninattention, or six or more symptoms of hyperactivity\\nand impulsivity combined:\\nInattention:\\n• fails to pay close attention to detail or makes careless\\nmistakes in schoolwork or other activities\\n• has difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or activities\\n• does not appear to listen when spoken to\\n• does not follow through on instructions and does not\\nfinish tasks\\n• has difficulty organizing tasks and activities\\n• avoids or dislikes tasks that require sustained mental\\neffort (e.g., homework)\\n• is easily distracted\\n• is forgetful in daily activities\\nHyperactivity:\\n• fidgets with hands or feet or squirms in seat\\n• does not remain seated when expected to\\n• runs or climbs excessively when inappropriate (in ado-\\nlescence and adults, feelings of restlessness)\\n• has difficulty playing quietly\\n• is constantly on the move\\n• talks excessively\\nImpulsivity:\\n• blurts out answers before the question has been com-\\npleted\\n• has difficulty waiting for his or her turn\\n• interrupts and/or intrudes on others\\nDSM-IV also requires that some symptoms develop\\nbefore age seven, and that they significantly impair func-\\ntioning in two or more settings (e.g., home and school)\\nfor a period of at least six months. Children who meet the\\nsymptom criteria for inattention, but not for hyperactivi-\\nty/impulsivity are diagnosed with Attention-Deficit/\\nHyperactivity Disorder, Predominantly Inattentive Type,\\ncommonly called ADD. (Young girls with ADHD may\\nnot be diagnosed because they have mainly this subtype\\nof the disorder.)\\nDiagnosis\\nThe first step in determining if a child has ADHD is\\nto consult with a pediatrician. The pediatrician can make\\nan initial evaluation of the child’s developmental maturi-\\nty compared to other children in his or her age group.\\nThe physician should also perform a comprehensive\\nphysical examinationto rule out any organic causes of\\nADHD symptoms, such as an overactive thyroid or\\nvision or hearing problems.\\nIf no organic problem can be found, a psychologist,\\npsychiatrist, neurologist, neuropsychologist, or learning\\nspecialist is typically consulted to perform a comprehen-\\nsive ADHD assessment. A complete medical, family,\\nsocial, psychiatric, and educational history is compiled\\nfrom existing medical and school records and from\\ninterviews with parents and teachers. Interviews may\\nalso be conducted with the child, depending on his or\\nher age. Along with these interviews, several clinical\\ninventories may also be used, such as the Conners Rat-\\ning Scales (Teacher’s Questionnaire and Parent’s Ques-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 411\\nAttention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 411'),\n",

These inven-\\ntories provide valuable information on the child’s behav-\\nior in different settings and situations. In addition, the\\nWender Utah Rating Scale has been adapted for use in\\ndiagnosing ADHD in adults.\\nIt is important to note that mental disorders such as\\ndepression and anxiety disorder can cause symptoms\\nsimilar to ADHD. A complete and comprehensive psy-\\nchiatric assessment is critical to differentiate ADHD\\nfrom other possible mood and behavioral disorders.\\nBipolar disorder, for example, may be misdiagnosed, as\\nADHD.\\nPublic schools are required by federal law to offer\\nfree ADHD testing upon request. A pediatrician can also\\nprovide a referral to a psychologist or pediatric specialist\\nfor ADHD assessment. Parents should check with their\\ninsurance plans to see if these services are covered.\\nTreatment\\nPsychosocial therapy, usually combined with med-\\nications, is the treatment approach of choice to alleviate\\nADHD symptoms. Psychostimulants, such as dextroam-\\nphetamine (Dexedrine), pemoline (Cylert), and methyl-\\nphenidate (Ritalin) are commonly prescribed to control\\nhyperactive and impulsive behavior and increase atten-\\ntion span. They work by stimulating the production of\\ncertain neurotransmitters in the brain. Possible side\\neffects of stimulants include nervous tics, irregular heart-\\nbeat, loss of appetite, and insomnia. However, the med-\\nications are usually well-tolerated and safe in most cases.\\nIn children who don’t respond well to stimulant ther-\\napy, tricyclic antidepressants such as desipramine (Nor-\\npramin, Pertofane) and amitriptyline (Elavil) are fre-\\nquently recommended. Reported side effects of these\\ndrugs include persistent dry mouth, sedation, disorien-\\ntation, and cardiac arrhythmia (particularly with\\ndesipramine). Other medications prescribed for ADHD\\ntherapy include buproprion (Wellbutrin), an antidepres-\\nsant; fluoxetine (Prozac), an SSRI antidepressant; and\\ncarbamazepine (Tegretol, Atretol), an anticonvulsant\\ndrug. Clonidine (Catapres), an antihypertensive medica-\\ntion, has also been used to control aggression and hyper-\\nactivity in some ADHD children, although it should not\\nbe used with Ritalin. A child’s response to medication\\nwill change with age and maturation, so ADHD symp-\\ntoms should be monitored closely and prescriptions\\nadjusted accordingly.\\nBehavior modification therapy uses a reward system\\nto reinforce good behavior and task completion and can\\nbe implemented both in the classroom and at home. A\\ntangible reward such as a sticker may be given to the child\\nevery time he completes a task or behaves in an accept-\\nable manner. A chart system may be used to display the\\nstickers and visually illustrate the child’s progress. When\\na certain number of stickers are collected, the child may\\ntrade them in for a bigger reward such as a trip to the zoo\\nor a day at the beach. The reward system stays in place\\nuntil the good behavior becomes ingrained.\\nA variation of this technique, cognitive-behavioral\\ntherapy , works to decrease impulsive behavior by get-\\nting the child to recognize the connection between\\nthoughts and behavior, and to change behavior by chang-\\ning negative thinking patterns.\\nIndividual psychotherapy can help an ADHD child\\nbuild self-esteem, give them a place to discuss their wor-\\nries and anxieties, and help them gain insight into their\\nbehavior and feelings. Family therapy may also be ben-\\neficial in helping family members develop coping skills\\nand in working through feelings of guilt or anger parents\\nmay be experiencing.\\nADHD children perform better within a familiar,\\nconsistent, and structured routine with positive reinforce-\\nments for good behavior and real consequences for bad.\\nFamily, friends, and caretakers should all be educated on\\nthe special needs and behaviors of the ADHD child.\\nCommunication between parents and teachers is espe-\\ncially critical to ensuring an ADHD child has an appro-\\npriate learning environment.\\nAlternative treatment\\nA number of alternative treatments exist for ADHD.\\nAlthough there is a lack of controlled studies to prove\\ntheir efficacy, proponents report that they are successful\\nin controlling symptoms in some ADHD patients.

Based in part on the Feingold food\\nallergy diet, dietary therapy focuses on a nutritional\\nplan that is high in protein and complex carbohydrates\\nand free of white sugar and salicylate-containing foods\\nsuch as strawberries, tomatoes, and grapes.\\n• Herbal therapy. Herbal therapy uses a variety of natur-\\nal remedies to address the symptoms of ADHD, such\\nas ginkgo (Gingko biloba ) for memory and mental\\nsharpness and chamomile ( Matricaria recutita) extract\\nfor calming.

The test is performed\\nwith the use of electronic equipment called an audiome-\\nter. This testing is usually administered by a trained tech-\\nnician called an audiologist.\\nPurpose\\nAudiometry testing is used to identify and diagnose\\nhearing loss. The equipment is used in health screening\\nprograms, for example in grade schools, to detect hearing\\nproblems in children. It is also used in the doctor’s office or\\nhospital audiology department to diagnose hearing prob-\\nlems in children, adults, and the elderly. With correct diag-\\nnosis of a person’s specific pattern of hearing impairment,\\nthe right type of therapy, which might include hearing aids,\\ncorrective surgery, or speech therapy, can be prescribed.\\nPrecautions\\nTesting with audiometry equipment is simple and\\npainless. No special precautions are required.\\nDescription\\nA trained audiologist (a specialist in detecting hear-\\ning loss) uses an audiometer to conduct audiometry test-\\ning. This equipment emits sounds or tones, like musical\\nnotes, at various frequencies, or pitches, and at differing\\nvolumes or levels of loudness. Testing is usually done in\\na soundproof testing room.\\nThe person being tested wears a set of headphones\\nthat blocks out other distracting sounds and delivers a\\ntest tone to one ear at a time. At the sound of a tone, the\\npatient holds up a hand or finger to indicate that the\\nsound is detected. The audiologist lowers the volume and\\nrepeats the sound until the patient can no longer detect it.\\nThis process is repeated over a wide range of tones or\\nfrequencies from very deep, low sounds, like the lowest\\nnote played on a tuba, to very high sounds, like the ping-\\ning of a triangle. Each ear is tested separately. It is not\\nunusual for levels of sensitivity to sound to differ from\\none ear to the other.\\nA second type of audiometry testing uses a headband\\nrather than headphones. The headband is worn with small\\nplastic rectangles that fit behind the ears to conduct sound\\nthrough the bones of the skull. The patient being tested\\nsenses the tones that are transmitted as vibrations through\\nthe bones to the inner ear. As with the headphones, the\\ntones are repeated at various frequencies and volumes.\\nThe results of the audiometry test may be recorded\\non a grid or graph called an audiogram. This graph is\\ngenerally set up with low frequencies or tones at one end\\nand high ones at the other end, much like a piano key-\\nboard. Low notes are graphed on the left and high notes\\non the right. The graph also charts the volume of the\\ntones used; from soft, quiet sounds at the top of the chart\\nto loud sounds at the bottom. Hearing is measured in\\nunits called decibels. Most of the sounds associated with\\nnormal speech patterns are generally spoken in the range\\nof 20-50 decibels. An adult with normal hearing can\\ndetect tones between 0-20 decibels.\\nSpeech audiometry is another type of testing that\\nuses a series of simple recorded words spoken at various\\nvolumes into headphones worn by the patient being test-\\ned. The patient repeats each word back to the audiologist\\nas it is heard. An adult with normal hearing will be able\\nto recognize and repeat 90-100% of the words.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2414\\nAudiometry\\nAn audiologist conducting a hearing test.

Some of these disorders include\\nattention deficit/hyperactive disorder(ADHD), autism,\\ndyslexia, and central auditory processing disorders\\n(CAPD). Training the patient to listen can stimulate cen-\\ntral and cortical organization.\\nAuditory integration is one facet of what audiolo-\\ngists call central auditory processing. The simplest defin-\\nition of central auditory processing, or CAP, is Universi-\\nty of Buffalo Professor of Audiology Jack Katz’s, which\\nis: “What we do with what we hear.” Central auditory\\nintegration is actually the perception of sound, including\\nthe ability to attend to sound, to remember it, retaining it\\nin both the long- and short-term memory, to be able to\\nlisten to sound selectively, and to localize it.\\nGuy Berard developed one of the programs com-\\nmonly used. Berard’s auditory integration training con-\\nsists of twenty half-hour sessions spent listening to musi-\\ncal sounds via a stereophonic system. The music is ran-\\ndom, with filtered frequencies, and the person listens\\nthrough earphones. These sound waves vibrate and exer-\\ncise structures in the middle ear. This is normally done in\\nsessions twice a day for 10 days.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 415\\nAuditory integration training\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 415'),\n",

This device operates through a series of filters, and\\nreestablishes the dominance of the right ear in hearing. The\\nbasis of Tomatis’ work is a series of principles that follow:\\n• The most important purpose of the ear is to adapt sound\\nwaves into signals that charge the brain.\\n• Sound is conducted via both air and bone. It can be\\nconsidered something that nourishes the nervous sys-\\ntem, either stimulating or destimulating it.\\n• Just as seeing is not the same as looking, hearing is not\\nthe same as listening. Hearing is passive. Listening is\\nactive.\\n• A person’s ability to listen affects all language develop-\\nment for that person. This process influences every\\naspect of self-image and social development.\\n• The capacity to listen can be changed or improved\\nthrough auditory stimulation using musical and vocal\\nsounds at high frequencies.\\nALFRED TOMATIS (1920– )\\n• Communication begins in the womb. As early as the\\nbeginning of the second trimester, fetuses can hear\\nsounds. These sounds literally cause the brain and ner-\\nvous system of the baby to develop.\\nDescription\\nA quartet of CAP defects have been identified that\\ncan unfavorably alter how each person processes sound.\\nAmong these are:\\n• Phonetic decoding, a problem that occurs when the\\nbrain incorrectly decodes what is being heard. Sounds\\nare unrecognizable, often because the person speaking\\ntalks too fast.\\n• Tolerance-fading memory, a condition with little or\\npoor tolerance for background sounds.\\n• Auditory integration involves a person’s ability to put\\ntogether things heard with things seen. Characteristical-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2416\\nAuditory integration training\\nInternationally renowned French otolaryngologist,\\npsychologist, educator and inventor Alfred Tomatis per-\\nceived the importance of sound and hearing early in his\\ncareer. He took his degree as a Doctor of Medicine from\\nthe University of Paris and specialized in ear, nose and\\nthroat medicine. The son of two opera singers, Tomatis\\nearly in his career treated some of his parents’ fellow\\nopera singers. From these experiences with the sound of\\nmusic, he developed the principle that has come to be\\nknown as the Tomatis Effect, i.e. that the human voice can\\nonly sing what it hears.\\nTomatis has been called the Einstein of the ear. It was\\nhis research that made the world aware that the ears of an\\ninfant in utero are already functioning at four and half\\nmonths of age. Just as the umbilical cord provides nour-\\nishment to the unborn infant’s body, Tomatis postulated\\nthat the sound of the mother’s voice is also a nutrient\\nheard by the fetus. This sound literally charges and stimu-\\nlates the growth of the brain.\\nTomatis took this further, into the realm of language.\\nTomatis concluded that the need to communicate and to\\nbe understood are among our most basic needs. He was a\\npioneer in perceiving that language problems convert into\\nsocial problems for people. “Language is what character-\\nizes man and makes him different from other creatures,”\\nTomatis is quoted as saying. The techniques he developed\\nto teach people how to listen effectively are international-\\nly respected tools used in the treatment of autism, atten-\\ntion-deficit disorder, and other learning disabilities.\\nHis listening program, the invention of the Electronic\\nEar, and his work with the therapeutic use of sound and\\nmusic for the past fifty years have made Tomatis arguably\\nthe best known and most successful ear specialist in the\\nworld. There are more than two hundred Tomatis Centers\\nworldwide, treating a vast variety of problems related to\\nthe ability to hear.\\n(Photograph by V. Brynner. Gamma Liaison.

It is characterized\\nby disorganization in handling auditory and other infor-\\nmation.\\nCertain audiological tests are carried out to see if the\\nperson has a CAP problem, and if so, how severe it is.\\nOther tests give more specific information regarding the\\nnature of the CAP problem. They include:\\n• Puretone air-conduction threshold testing, which mea-\\nsures peripheral hearing loss. If loss is found, then\\nbone-conduction testing, or evaluation of the vibration\\nof small bones in the inner ear, is also carried out.\\n• Word discrimination scores (WDS) determines a per-\\nson’s clarity in hearing ideal speech. This is done by\\npresenting 25–50 words at 40 decibels above the per-\\nson’s average sound threshold in each ear. Test scores\\nequal the percentage of words heard correctly.\\n• Immittance testing is made up of two parts, assessing\\nthe status of, and the protective mechanisms of the mid-\\ndle ear.\\n• Staggered sporadic word (SSW) testing delivers 40\\ncompound words in an overlapping way at 50 decibels\\nabove threshold to each ear of the person being tested.\\nThis test provides expanded information that makes it\\npossible to break down CAP problems into the four\\nbasic types.\\n• Speech in noise discrimination (SN) testing is similar to\\nStaggered Sporadic Word testing except that other noise\\nis also added and the percentage correct in quiet is com-\\npared with that correct when there is added noise.\\n• Phonemic synthesis (PS) determines serious learning\\nproblems. The types of errors made in sounding out\\nwritten words or associating written letters with the\\nsounds they represent help in determining the type and\\nseverity of CAP problems.\\nPurpose\\nUpon completion of an auditory integration training\\nprogram, the person’s hearing should be capable of per-\\nceiving all frequencies at, or near, the same level. Total\\nimprovement from this therapy, in both hearing and\\nbehavior, can take up to one year.\\nResearch and general acceptance\\nAuditory integration training is based upon newly\\nlearned information about the brain. Though brain struc-\\ntures and connections are predetermined, probably by\\nheredity, another factor called plasticity also comes into\\nplay. Learning, we now know, continues from birth to\\ndeath. Plasticity is the ability of the brain to actually\\nchange its structuring and connections through the\\nprocess of learning.\\nProblems with auditory processing are now viewed\\nas having a wide–reaching ripple effect on our society. It\\nis estimated that 30–40% of children starting school have\\nlanguage-learning skills that can be described as poor.\\nCAP difficulties are a factor in several different learning\\ndisabilities. They affect not only academic success, but\\nalso nearly every aspect of societal difficulties.

A person with\\nautism must learn how to communicate normally and\\nhow to relate to people, objects and events. However,\\nnot all patients suffer the same degree of impairment.\\nThere is a full spectrum of symptoms, which can range\\nfrom mild to severe.\\nAutism occurs in as many as one or two per 1,000\\nchildren. It is found four times more often in boys (usual-\\nly the first-born) and occurs around the world in all races\\nand social backgrounds. Autism usually is evident in the\\nfirst three years of life, although in some children it’s\\nhard to tell when the problem develops. Sometimes the\\ncondition isn’t diagnosed until the child enters school.\\nWhile a person with autism can have symptoms\\nranging from mild to severe, about 10% have an extraor-\\ndinary ability in one area, such as in mathematics, mem-\\nory, music, or art. Such children are known as “autistic\\nsavants” (formerly known as “idiot savants.”).\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAutism is a brain disorder that affects the way the\\nbrain uses or transmits information. Studies have found\\nabnormalities in several parts of the brain that almost\\ncertainly occurred during fetal development. The prob-\\nlem may be centered in the parts of the brain responsible\\nfor processing language and information from the senses.\\nThere appears to be a strong genetic basis for\\nautism. Identical twins are more likely to both be\\naffected than twins who are fraternal (not genetically\\nidentical). In a family with one autistic child, the\\nchance of having another child with autism is about 1\\nin 20, much higher than in the normal population.\\nSometimes, relatives of an autistic child have mild\\nbehaviors that look very much like autism, such as\\nrepetitive behaviors and social or communication prob-\\nlems. Research also has found that some emotional dis-\\norders (such as manic depression) occur more often in\\nfamilies of a child with autism.\\nAt least one group of researchers has found a link\\nbetween an abnormal gene and autism. The gene may be\\njust one of at least three to five genes that interact in\\nsome way to cause the condition. Scientists suspect that a\\nfaulty gene or genes might make a person vulnerable to\\ndevelop autism in the presence of other factors, such as a\\nchemical imbalance, viruses or chemicals, or a lack of\\noxygen at birth.\\nIn a few cases, autistic behavior is caused by a dis-\\nease such as:\\n• rubella in the pregnant mother\\n• tuberous sclerosis\\n• fragile X syndrome\\n• encephalitis\\n• untreated phenylketonuria.\\nThe severity of the condition varies between individ-\\nuals, ranging from the most severe (extremely unusual,\\nrepetitive, self- injurious, and aggressive behavior) to\\nvery mild, resembling a personality disorder with some\\nlearning disability.\\nProfound problems with social interaction are the\\nmost common symptoms of autism. Infants with the dis-\\norder won’t cuddle; they avoid eye contact and don’t\\nseem to want or need physical contact or affection. They\\nmay become rigid or flaccid when they are held, cry when\\npicked up, and show little interest in human contact. Such\\na child doesn’t smile or lift his arms in anticipation of\\nbeing picked up. He forms no attachment to parents nor\\nshows any normal anxiety toward strangers. He doesn’t\\nlearn typical games of childhood, such as peek-a-boo.\\nLanguage problems\\nThe child with autism may not speak at all; if he\\ndoes, it is often in single words. He may endlessly repeat\\nwords or phrases that are addressed to him and may\\nreverse pronouns (“You go sleep” instead of “I want to\\ngo to sleep”).\\nRestricted interests and activity\\nUsually a child with autism has many problems\\nplaying normally. He probably won’t act out adultroles\\nduring play time, and instead of enjoying fantasy play, he\\nmay simply repeatedly mimic the actions of someone\\nelse. Bizarre behavior patterns are very common among\\nautistic children and may include complex rituals,\\nscreaming fits, rhythmic rocking, arm flapping, finger\\ntwiddling, and crying without tears. Autistic children\\nmay play with their own saliva, feces or urine.They may\\nbe self-destructive, biting their own hands, gouging at\\ntheir eyes, pulling their hair, or banging their head.\\nSensory problems\\nThe sensory world poses a real problem to many\\nautistic children, who seem overwhelmed by their own\\nsenses. A child with autism may ignore objects or\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2418\\nAutism\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 418'),\n",

Many of\\nthese children may react to sounds by banging their head\\nor flapping fingers. Some high-functioning autistic adults\\nwho have written books about their childhood experi-\\nences report that sounds were often excruciatingly\\npainful to them, forcing them to withdraw from their\\nenvironment or try to cope by withdrawing into their own\\nworld of sensation and movement.\\nIntellectual problems\\nMost autistic children appear to be moderately mental-\\nly retarded. They may giggle or cry for no reason, have no\\nfear of real danger, but exhibit terror of harmless objects.\\nDiagnosis\\nThere is no medical test for autism. Because the\\nsymptoms of autism are so varied, the condition may go\\nundiagnosed for some time (especially in those with mild\\ncases or if other handicaps are also present). It may be\\nconfused with other diseases, such as fragile X syndrome,\\ntuberous sclerosis, and untreated phenylketonuria.\\nAutism is diagnosed by observing the child’s behav-\\nior, communication skills, and social interactions. Med-\\nical tests should rule out other possible causes of autistic\\nsymptoms. Criteria that mental health experts use to\\ndiagnose autism include:\\n• problems with developing friendships\\n• problems with make-believe or social play\\n• endlessly repeated words or strings of words\\n• difficulty in carrying on a conversation\\n• obsessions with rituals or restricted patterns\\n• preoccupation with parts of objects\\nSome children have a few of the symptoms of autism,\\nbut not enough to be diagnosed with the “classical” form\\nof the condition. Children who have autistic behavior but\\nno problems with language may be diagnosed with\\n“Asperger syndrome.” Children who seem normal at first\\nbut who begin to show autistic behavior as they get older\\nmight be diagnosed with “childhood disintegrative disor-\\nder” (CDD). These problems are sometimes called “autis-\\ntic spectrum disorders.” It is also important to rule out\\nother problems that seem similar to autism.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 419\\nAutism\\nThis autistic child is encouraged to interact with the guinea pig in an effort to improve his social interaction.(Helen B.

Autoimmune diseases are classified as either\\ngeneral, in which the autoimmune reaction takes place\\nsimultaneously in a number of tissues, or organ specific, in\\nwhich the autoimmune reaction targets a single organ.\\nAutoimmune disorders include the following:\\n• Systemic lupus erythematosus . A general autoim-\\nmune disease in which antibodies attack a number of\\ndifferent tissues. The disease recurs periodically and is\\nseen mainly in young and middle-aged women.\\n• Rheumatoid arthritis . Occurs when the immune sys-\\ntem attacks and destroys the tissues that line bone joints\\nand cartilage. The disease occurs throughout the body,\\nalthough some joints may be more affected than others.\\n• Goodpasture’s syndrome. Occurs when antibodies are\\ndeposited in the membranes of both the lung and kid-\\nneys, causing both inflammation of kidney glomerulus\\n(glomerulonephritis) and lung bleeding. It is typically\\na disease of young males.\\n• Grave’s disease. Caused by an antibody that binds to\\nspecific cells in the thyroid gland, causing them to\\nmake excessive amounts of thyroid hormone.\\n• Hashimoto’s thyroiditis . Caused by an antibody that\\nbinds to cells in the thyroid gland. Unlike in Grave’s\\ndisease, however, this antibody’s action results in less\\nthyroid hormone being made.\\n• Pemphigus vulgaris. A group of autoimmune disorders\\nthat affect the skin.\\n• Myasthenia gravis . A condition in which the immune\\nsystem attacks a receptor on the surface of muscle cells,\\npreventing the muscle from receiving nerve impulses\\nand resulting in severe muscle weakness.\\n• Scleroderma . Also called CREST syndrome or pro-\\ngressive systemic sclerosis, scleroderma affects the\\nconnective tissue.\\n• Autoimmune hemolytic anemia . Occurs when the\\nbody produces antibodies that coat red blood cells.\\n• Autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura. Disorder in\\nwhich the immune system targets and destroys blood\\nplatelets.\\n• Polymyositis and Dermatomyositis. Immune disorders\\nthat affect the neuromuscular system.\\n• Pernicious anemia . Disorder in which the immune\\nsystem attacks the lining of the stomach in such a way\\nthat the body cannot metabolize vitamin B12.\\n• Sjögren’s syndrome. Occurs when the exocrine glands\\nare attacked by the immune system, resulting in exces-\\nsive dryness.\\n• Ankylosing spondylitis . Immune system induced\\ndegeneration of the joints and soft tissue of the spine.\\n• Vasculitis. A group of autoimmune disorders in which\\nthe immune system attacks and destroys blood vessels.\\n• Type I diabetes mellitus . May be caused by an anti-\\nbody that attacks and destroys the islet cells of the pan-\\ncreas, which produce insulin.\\n• Amyotrophic lateral schlerosis. Also called Lou\\nGehrig’s disease. An immune disorder that causes the\\ndeathof neurons which leads to progressive loss of\\nmuscular control.\\n• Guillain-Barre syndrome. Also called infectious\\npolyneuritis. Often occurring after an infection or an\\nimmunization (specifically Swine flu), the disease\\naffects the myelin sheath, which coats nerve cells. It\\ncauses progressive muscle weakness and paralysis.\\n• Multiple sclerosis . An autoimmune disorder that may\\ninvolve a virus affects the central nervous system, caus-\\ning loss of coordination and muscle control.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nTo further understand autoimmune disorders, it is\\nhelpful to understand the workings of the immune sys-\\ntem. The purpose of the immune system is to defend the\\nbody against attack by infectious microbes (germs) and\\nforeign objects. When the immune system attacks an\\ninvader, it is very specific—a particular immune system\\ncell will only recognize and target one type of invader.\\nTo function properly, the immune system must not only\\ndevelop this specialized knowledge of individual\\ninvaders, but it must also learn how to recognize and\\nnot destroy cells that belong to the body itself. Every\\ncell carries protein markers on its surface that identifies\\nit in one of two ways: what kind of cell it is (e.g. nerve\\ncell, muscle cell, blood cell, etc.) and to whom that cell\\nbelongs. These markers are called major histocompata-\\nbility complexes (MHCs). When functioning properly,\\ncells of the immune system will not attack any other\\ncell with markers identifying it as belonging to the\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2422\\nAutoimmune disorders\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 422'),\n",

Conversely, if the immune system cells do not\\nrecognize the cell as “self,” they attach themselves to it\\nand put out a signal that the body has been invaded,\\nwhich in turn stimulates the production of substances\\nsuch as antibodies that engulf and destroy the foreign\\nparticles. In case of autoimmune disorders, the immune\\nsystem cannot distinguish between “self” cells and\\ninvader cells. As a result, the same destructive operation\\nis carried out on the body’s own cells that would nor-\\nmally be carried out on bacteria, viruses, and other such\\nharmful entities.\\nThe reasons why immune systems become dys-\\nfunctional in this way is not well understood. However,\\nmost researchers agree that a combination of genetic,\\nenvironmental, and hormonal factors play into autoim-\\nmunity. Researchers also speculate that certain mecha-\\nnisms may trigger autoimmunity. First, a substance that\\nis normally restricted to one part of the body, and there-\\nfore not usually exposed to the immune system, is\\nreleased into other areas where it is attacked. Second,\\nthe immune system may mistake a component of the\\nbody for a similar foreign component. Third, cells of\\nthe body may be altered in some way, either by drugs,\\ninfection, or some other environmental factor, so that\\nthey are no longer recognizable as “self” to the immune\\nsystem. Fourth, the immune system itself may be dam-\\naged, such as by a genetic mutation, and therefore can-\\nnot function properly.\\nSymptoms\\nThe symptoms of the above disorders include:\\n• Systemic lupus erythematosus. Symptoms include\\nfever, chills, fatigue, weight loss, skin rashes (particu-\\nlarly the classic “butterfly” rash on the face), vasculitis,\\npolyarthralgia, patchy hair loss, sores in the mouth or\\nnose, lymph-node enlargement, gastric problems, and,\\nin women, irregular periods. About half of those who\\nsuffer from lupus develop cardiopulmonary problems,\\nand some may also develop urinary problems. Lupus\\ncan also effect the central nervous system, causing\\nseizures, depression, and psychosis.\\n• Rheumatoid arthritis. Initially may be characterized by a\\nlow-grade fever, loss of appetite, weight loss, and a gener-\\nalized pain in the joints. The joint pain then becomes\\nmore specific, usually beginning in the fingers, then\\nspreading to other areas, such as the wrists, elbows,\\nknees, and ankles. As the disease progresses, joint func-\\ntion diminishes sharply and deformities occur, particular-\\nly the characteristic “swan’s neck” curling of the fingers.\\n• Goodpasture’s syndrome. Symptoms are similar to that\\nof iron deficiency anemia , including fatigue and pal-\\nlor. Symptoms involving the lungs may range from a\\ncough that produces bloody sputum to outright hemor-\\nrhaging. Symptoms involving the urinary system\\ninclude blood in the urine and/or swelling.\\n• Grave’s disease. This disease is characterized by an\\nenlarged thyroid gland, weight loss without loss of\\nappetite, sweating, heart palpitations , nervousness,\\nand an inability to tolerate heat.\\n• Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. This disorder generally dis-\\nplays no symptoms.\\n• Pemphigus vulgaris. This disease is characterized by\\nblisters and deep lesions on the skin.\\n• Myasthenia gravis. Characterized by fatigue and mus-\\ncle weakness that at first may be confined to certain\\nmuscle groups, but then may progress to the point of\\nparalysis. Myasthenia gravis patients often have expres-\\nsionless faces as well as difficulty chewing and swal-\\nlowing. If the disease progresses to the respiratory sys-\\ntem, artificial respiration may be required.\\n• Scleroderma. Disorder is usually preceded by Ray-\\nnaud’s phenomenon. Symptoms that follow include\\npain, swelling, and stiffness of the joints, and the skin\\ntakes on a tight, shiny appearance. The digestive system\\nalso becomes involved, resulting in weight loss, appetite\\nloss,diarrhea, constipation , and distention of the\\nabdomen. As the disease progresses, the heart, lungs,\\nand kidneys become involved, and malignant hyperten-\\nsion causes death in approximately 30% of cases.\\n• Autoimmune hemolytic anemia. May be acute or\\nchronic. Symptoms include fatigue and abdominal ten-\\nderness due to an enlarged spleen.\\n• Autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura. Characterized\\nby pinhead-size red dots on the skin, unexplained\\nbruises, bleeding from the nose and gums, and blood in\\nthe stool.\\n• Polymyositis and Dermatomyositis. In polymyositis,\\nsymptoms include muscle weakness, particularly in the\\nshoulders or pelvis, that prevents the patient from per-\\nforming everyday activities. In dermatomyositis, the\\nsame muscle weakness is accompanied by a rash that\\nappears on the upper body, arms, and fingertips. A rash\\nmay also appear on the eyelids, and the area around the\\neyes may become swollen.\\n• Pernicious anemia. Signs of pernicious anemia\\ninclude weakness, sore tongue, bleeding gums, and\\ntingling in the extremities. Because the disease caus-\\nes a decrease in stomach acid, nausea, vomiting, loss\\nof appetite, weight loss, diarrhea, and constipation\\nare possible.

The pain may\\neventually become crippling.\\n• Vasculitis. Symptoms depend upon the group of veins\\naffected and can range greatly.\\n• Type I diabetes mellitus. Characterized by fatigue and\\nan abnormally high level of glucose in the blood\\n(hyperglycemia).\\n• Amyotrophic lateral schlerosis. First signs are stum-\\nbling and difficulty climbing stairs. Later, muscle\\ncramps and twitching may be observed as well as\\nweakness in the hands making fastening buttons or\\nturning a key difficult. Speech may become slowed or\\nslurred. There may also be difficluty swallowing. As\\nrespiratory muscles atrophy, there is increased danger\\nof aspiration or lung infection.\\n• Guillain-Barre syndrome. Muscle weakness in the legs\\noccurs first, then the arms and face. Paresthesias (a\\nprickly, tingling sensation) is also felt. This disorder\\naffects both sides of the body and may involve paralysis\\nand the muscles that control breathing.\\n• Multiple sclerosis. Like Lou Gehrig’s disease, the first\\nsymptom may be clumsiness. Weakness or exhaustion\\nis often reported, as well as blurry or double vision.\\nThere may be dizziness , depression, loss of bladder\\ncontrol, and muscle weakness so severe that the patient\\nis confined to a wheelchair.\\nDiagnosis\\nA number of tests are involved in the diagnosis of\\nautoimmune diseases, depending on the particular dis-\\nease; e.g. blood tests, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, elec-\\ntromylogram (measures muscle function), and magnetic\\nresonance imaging of the brain. Usually, these tests\\ndetermine the location and extent of damage or involve-\\nment. They are useful in charting progress of the disease\\nand as baselines for treatment.\\nThe principle tool, however, for authenticating\\nautoimmune disease is antibody testing. Such tests\\ninvolve measuring the level of antibodies found in the\\nblood and determining if they react with specific anti-\\ngens that would give rise to an autoimmune reaction. An\\nelevated amount of antibodies indicates that a humoral\\nimmune reaction is occurring. Since elevated antibody\\nlevels are also seen in common infections, they must be\\nruled out as the cause for the increased antibody levels.\\nAntibodies can also be typed by class. There are five\\nclasses of antibodies, and they can be separated in the\\nlaboratory. The class IgG is usually associated with\\nautoimmune diseases. Unfortunately, IgG class antibod-\\nies are also the main class of antibody seen in normal\\nimmune responses.\\nThe most useful antibody tests involve introducing\\nthe patient’s antibodies to samples of his or her own tis-\\nsue, usually thyroid, stomach, liver, and kidney tissue. If\\nantibodies bind to the “self” tissue, it is diagnostic for an\\nautoimmune disorder. Antibodies from a person without\\nan autoimmune disorder would not react to “self” tissue.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of autoimmune diseases is specific to\\nthe disease, and usually concentrates on alleviating or\\npreventing symptoms rather than correcting the under-\\nlying cause. For example, if a gland involved in an\\nautoimmune reaction is not producing a hormone such\\nas insulin, administration of that hormone is required.\\nAdministration of a hormone, however, will restore\\nthe function of the gland damaged by the autoimmune\\ndisease.\\nThe other aspect of treatment is controlling the\\ninflammatory and proliferative nature of the immune\\nresponse. This is generally accomplished with two types\\nof drugs. Steroid compounds are used to control inflam-\\nmation. There are many different steroids, each having\\nside effects. The proliferative nature of the immune\\nresponse is controlled with immunosuppressive drugs.\\nThese drugs work by inhibiting the replication of cells\\nand, therefore, also suppress non-immune cells leading\\nto side effects such as anemia.\\nSystemic enzyme therapy is a new treatment that is\\nshowing results for rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclero-\\nsis, ankylosing spondylitis, and other inflammatory dis-\\neases. Enzymes combinations of pancreatin, trypsin,\\nchymotrypsin, bromelain, and papain help stimulate the\\nbody’s own defenses, accelerate inflammation in order to\\nreduce swelling and improve circulation, and break up\\nthe immune complexes within the bloodstream. Symp-\\ntoms have been reduced using this treatment.\\nOther treatments that hold some promise are irradia-\\ntion of the spleen and gene therapy. Splenic irradiation\\nis touted to be a safe, alternative for patients with autoim-\\nmune blood diseases, especially autoimmune hemolytic\\nanemia, or others with compromised immune systems,\\nsuch as HIV patients and the elderly.

Larson, RPT\\nAviation medicine\\nDefinition\\nAlso known as aerospace medicine, flight medicine,\\nor space medicine, aviation medicine is a medical spe-\\ncialty that focuses on the physical and psychological\\nconditions associated with flying and space travel.\\nPurpose\\nSince flying airplanes and spacecraft involves great\\nrisk and physical demands, such as changes in gravity\\nand oxygen, pilots and astronauts need medical experts\\nto protect their safety and the public’s safety.\\nDescription\\nPressure changes\\nIn the United States, the Federal Aviation Adminis-\\ntration (FAA) requires all pilots who fly above 14,500 ft\\n(4,420 m) to be prepared for pressure changes caused by\\nlower oxygen levels at high altitude. Pilots must either\\nhave a pressurized cabin or access to an oxygen mask.\\nWithout these protections, they could experience hypox-\\nia, or altitude sickness . Hypoxia reduces the amount of\\noxygen in the brain, causing such symptoms as\\ndizziness, shortness of breath , and mental confusion.\\nThese symptoms could cause the pilot to lose control of\\nthe plane. Hypoxia can be treated with oxygen therapy.\\nRapid altitude increases and decreases can cause\\npain because there is an air pocket in the middle portion\\nof the ear. To equalize pressure in the ear, physicians typ-\\nically advise pilots and passengers to clear their sinuses\\nby plugging their nose and blowing until the eardrums\\n“pop.” Other options include yawning, swallowing or\\nchewing gum. For people with a cold or a severely\\nblocked middle ear, the use of decongestants, antihista-\\nmines, or nasal sprays may help. Without taking steps to\\nequalize pressure, the tympanic membrane could rupture,\\ncausing hearing loss, vertigo, dizziness, and nausea.\\nGravity’s impact\\nFighter pilots who fly high-performance jets can\\nexperience health problems during rapid acceleration and\\nwhen executing tight turns at high speed. During these\\nmoves, a pilot experiences extreme gravity conditions\\nthat can pull blood away from the brain and heart and\\ninto the lower body. This can cause the pilot to have tun-\\nnel vision or pass out. To prevent these potentially deadly\\nsituations, the military requires fighter pilots to wear spe-\\ncial flight suits, or G suits, which have compartments\\nthat fill with air or fluid to keep blood from pooling in\\nthe lower body.\\nSome pilots, like the Blue Angels, use a technique\\ncalled the Valsalva Maneuver instead of G suits to pre-\\nvent black outs during high-performance flying. The Val-\\nsalva Maneuver involves grunting and tightening the\\nabdominal muscles to stop blood from collecting in the\\nwrong parts of the body.\\nPREVENTIVE CARE. Since any routine health problem\\nthat affects a pilot could mean the loss of hundreds of\\nlives, aviation medicine specialists who work for com-\\nmercial airlines and the military take special care to edu-\\ncate pilots about proper diet,exercise and preventive\\nhealth tools. For example, physicians may frequently\\nscreen pilots for vision changes caused by glaucoma or\\ncataracts . They also will check for hearing loss and\\nencourage the pilot to wear earplugs or headphones to\\nbuffer engine noise. To monitor for heart disease, physi-\\ncians will check blood pressure and may order diagnostic\\ntests such as an ECG or stress test.\\nMotion sickness\\nMany people experience nausea, vertigo, and disori-\\nentation when they first arrive in space. This is caused by\\nchanges in the fluid in the inner ear, which is sensitive to\\ngravity and affects our sense of spatial orientation. The\\nsymptoms typically ease after several days, but often\\nrecur when the astronaut returns to Earth. To treat this\\ncondition, physicians give astronauts motion sickness\\nmedication, such as lorazepam.\\nBone and muscle loss\\nIn zero-gravity conditions, astronauts lose bone and\\nmuscle mass.

In space, however, astronauts must work harder to\\nprevent bone and muscle loss. Exercise is an important\\ntreatment. Crew members may use an exercise cycle or\\nresistive rubber bands to stay in shape. Physicians also may\\ngive them medication to prevent bone loss and prescribe\\nnutritional supplements, such as a mixture of essential\\namino acids and carbohydrates, to limit muscle atrophy.\\nRadiation\\nAnother health threat to space travelers is radiation.\\nHarmful rays can alter the DNA in human cells and\\ncause cancer.

According to the texts, Ayurveda\\nwas conceived by enlightened wise men as a system of\\nliving harmoniously and maintaining the body so that\\nmental and spiritual awareness could be possible.

Aided by the efforts of Deepak\\nChopra and the Maharishi, it has become an increasingly\\naccepted alternative medical treatment in America during\\nthe last two decades. Chopra is an M.D. who has written\\nseveral bestsellers based on Ayurvedic ideas. He also\\nhelped develop the Center for Mind/Body Medicine in\\nLa Jolla, California, a major Ayurvedic center that trains\\nphysicians in Ayurvedic principles, produces herbal\\nremedies, and conducts research and documentation of\\nits healing techniques.\\nKey ideas\\nTo understand Ayurvedic treatment, it is necessary to\\nhave an idea how the Ayurvedic system views the body.\\nThe basic life force in the body is prana, which is also\\nfound in the elements and is similar to the Chinese\\nnotion of chi. As Swami Vishnudevananda, a yogi and\\nexpert, put it, “Prana is in the air, but is not the oxygen,\\nnor any of its chemical constituents. It is in food, water,\\nand in the sunlight, yet it is not vitamin, heat, or light-\\nrays. Food, water, air, etc., are only the media through\\nwhich the prana is carried.”\\nIn Ayurveda, there are five basic elements that con-\\ntain prana: earth, water, fire, air, and ether. These ele-\\nments interact and are further organized in the human\\nbody as three main categories or basic physiological\\nprinciples in the body that govern all bodily functions\\nknown as the doshas . The three doshas are vata, pitta,\\nand kapha. Each person has a unique blend of the three\\ndoshas, known as the person’s prakriti , which is why\\nAyurvedic treatment is always individualized. In\\nAyurveda, disease is viewed as a state of imbalance in\\none or more of a person’s doshas, and an Ayurvedic\\nphysician strives to adjust and balance them, using a\\nvariety of techniques.\\nThe vata dosha is associated with air and ether, and\\nin the body promotes movement and lightness. Vata peo-\\nple are generally thin and light physically, dry-skinned,\\nand very energetic and mentally restless. When vata is\\nout of balance, there are often nervous problems, hyper-\\nactivity, sleeplessness, lower back pains, and headaches.\\nPitta is associated with fire and water. In the body, it\\nis responsible for metabolism and digestion. Pitta char-\\nacteristics are medium-built bodies, fair skin, strong\\ndigestion, and good mental concentration. Pitta imbal-\\nances show up as anger and aggression and stress-relat-\\ned conditions like gastritis , ulcers, liver problems, and\\nhypertension.\\nThe kapha dosha is associated with water and earth.\\nPeople characterized as kapha are generally large or\\nheavy with more oily complexions. They tend to be slow,\\ncalm, and peaceful. Kapha disorders manifest emotional-\\nly as greed and possessiveness, and physically as obesity,\\nfatigue, bronchitis, and sinus problems.\\nDiagnosis\\nIn Ayurvedic medicine, disease is always seen as an\\nimbalance in the dosha system, so the diagnostic process\\nstrives to determine which doshas are underactive or\\noveractive in a body. Diagnosis is often taken over a\\ncourse of days in order for the Ayurvedic physician to\\nmost accurately determine what parts of the body are\\nbeing affected. To diagnose problems, Ayurvedic physi-\\ncians often use long questionnaires and interviews to\\ndetermine a person’s dosha patterns and physical and\\npsychological histories. Ayurvedic physicians also intri-\\ncately observe the pulse, tongue, face, lips, eyes, and fin-\\ngernails for abnormalities or patterns that they believe\\ncan indicate deeper problems in the internal systems.\\nSome Ayurvedic physicians also use laboratory tests to\\nassist in diagnosis.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2430\\nAyurvedic medicine\\nAyurvedic Body Types\\nVata Pitta Kapha\\nPhysical characteristics Thin Average build Large build\\nProminent features Fair, thin hair Wavy, thick hair\\nCool, dry skin Warm, moist skin Pale, cool, oily skin\\nConstipation Ulcers, heartburn, and hemorrhoids Obesity, allergies, and sinus problems\\nCramps Acne High cholesterol\\nEmotional characteristics Moody Intense Relaxed\\nVivacious Quick tempered Not easily angered\\nImaginative Intelligent Affectionate\\nEnthusiastic Loving Tolerant\\nIntuitive Articulate Compassionate\\nBehavioral characteristics Unscheduled sleep and meal times Orderly Slow, graceful\\nNervous disorders Structured sleep and meal times Long sleeper and slow eater\\nAnxiety Perfectionist Procrastination\\nGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 430'),\n",

Usually the first\\nmethod of treatment involves some sort of detoxification\\nand cleansing of the body, in the belief that accumulated\\ntoxins must be removed before any other methods of\\ntreatment will be effective. Methods of detoxification\\ninclude therapeutic vomiting,laxatives, medicated ene-\\nmas, fasting, and cleansing of the sinuses. Many Ayur-\\nvedic clinics combine all of these cleansing methods into\\nintensive sessions known as panchakarma. Panchakarma\\ncan take several days or even weeks and they are more\\nthan elimination therapies. They also include herbalized\\noil massage and herbalized heat treatments. After purifi-\\ncation, Ayurvedic physicians use herbal and mineral\\nremedies to balance the body as well. Ayurvedic medicine\\ncontains a vast knowledge of the use of herbs for specific\\nhealth problems.\\nAyurvedic medicine also emphasizes how people live\\ntheir lives from day to day, believing that proper lifestyles\\nand routines accentuate balance, rest, diet, and preven-\\ntion. Ayurveda recommends yoga as a form of exercise to\\nbuild strength and health, and also advises massage thera-\\npy and self-massage as ways of increasing circulation and\\nreducing stress. Yogic breathing techniques and medita-\\ntion are also part of a healthy Ayurvedic regimen, to\\nreduce stress and improve mental energy.\\nOf all treatments, though, diet is one of the most\\nbasic and widely used therapy in the Ayurvedic system.\\nAn Ayurvedic diet can be a very well planned and indi-\\nvidualized regimen. According to Ayurveda, there are six\\nbasic tastes: sweet, sour, salty, pungent, bitter, and astrin-\\ngent. Certain tastes and foods can either calm or aggra-\\nvate a particular dosha. For instance, sweet, sour, and\\nsalty decrease vata problems and increase kapha. Sour,\\nsalty, and pungent can increase pitta. After an Ayurvedic\\nphysician determines a person’s dosha profile, they will\\nrecommend a specific diet to correct imbalances and\\nincrease health. The Ayurvedic diet emphasizes primarily\\nvegetarian foods of high quality and freshness, tailored to\\nthe season and time of day. Cooling foods are eaten in\\nthe summer and heating ones in the winter, always within\\na person’s dosha requirements. In daily routine, the heav-\\niest meal of the day should be lunch, and dinner should\\neaten well before bedtime, to allow for complete diges-\\ntion. Also, eating meals in a calm manner with proper\\nchewing and state of mind is important, as is combining\\nfoods properly and avoiding overeating.\\nCost\\nCosts of Ayurvedic treatments can vary, with initial\\nconsultations running anywhere from $40 to over $100,\\nKEY TERMS\\nDosha—One of three constitutional types, either\\nvata, pitta, or kapha, found in Ayurvedic medicine.\\nMeditation—Technique of calming the mind.\\nPanchakarma—Intensive Ayurvedic cleansing and\\ndetoxification program.\\nPrakriti—An individual’s unique dosha pattern.\\nPrana—Basic life energy found in the elements.\\nYoga—System of body and breathing exercises.\\nwith follow-up visits costing less. Herbal treatments may\\ncost from $10 to $50 per month, and are often available\\nfrom health food or bulk herb stores.

The prices for these programs can vary\\nsignificantly, depending on the services and length of\\nstay. Insurance reimbursement may depend on whether\\nthe primary physician is a licensed M.D.\\nPreparations\\nAyurveda is a mind/body system of health that con-\\ntains some ideas foreign to the Western scientific\\nmodel.

By 1995, fewer than 500 cases of babesiosis had\\nbeen reported in the United States. The disease occurs\\nprimarily in New England and New York, especially on\\nthe coastal islands. However, cases have occurred in\\nother parts of the United States. Because of tick activity,\\nthe risk for babesiosis is highest during June and July.\\nTicks are small, blood-sucking arachnids. Although\\nsome ticks carry disease-causing organisms, most do not.\\nBabesia microtiis spread to humans through the bite of\\nthe tick Ixodes scapularis (also called Ixodes dammini ).\\nIxodes scapularis, called the “blacklegged deer tick,” usu-\\nally feeds on deer and mice. A tick picks up the parasites\\nby feeding on an infected mouse and then passes them on\\nby biting a new host, possibly a human. To pass on the\\nparasites, the tick must be attached to the skin for 36-48\\nhours. Once in the bloodstream,Babesia microti enters a\\nred blood cell, reproduces by cell division, and destroys\\nthe cell. Humans infected with Babesia microti produce\\nantibodies that can be helpful in diagnosing the infection.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nBabesia microti live and divide within red blood\\ncells, destroying the cells and causing anemia. The\\nmajority of people who are infected have no visible\\nsymptoms. In those who become ill, symptoms appear\\none to six weeks following the tick bite. Because the\\nticks are small, many patients have no recollection of a\\ntick bite. The symptoms are flu-like and include tired-\\nness, loss of appetite,fever, drenching sweats, and mus-\\ncle pain. Nausea, vomiting, headache , shaking chills,\\nblood in the urine, and depression can occur.\\nPersons who are over 40 years old, have had their\\nspleen removed (splenectomized), and/or have a serious\\ndisease (cancer, AIDS, etc.) are at a greater risk for\\nsevere babesiosis. In severe cases of babesiosis, up to\\n85% of the blood cells can be infected. This causes a\\nserious, possibly fatal, blood deficiency.\\nDiagnosis\\nBabesiosis can be diagnosed by examining a blood\\nsample microscopically and detecting the presence of\\nBabesia microtiwithin the blood cells. The blood can also\\nbe checked for the presence of antibodies to the parasite.\\nTreatment\\nIn serious cases, babesiosis is treated with a combi-\\nnation of clindamycin (Cleocin) and quinine. Clin-\\ndamycin is given by injection and quinine is given orally\\nthree to four times a day for four to seven days. To\\nreduce the number of parasites in the blood, severely ill\\npatients have been treated with blood transfusions.\\nPrognosis\\nOtherwise healthy patients will recover completely.\\nBabesiosis may last several months without treatment\\nand is a severe, potentially fatal disease in splenec-\\ntomized patients.\\nPrevention\\nThe only prevention for babesiosis is to minimize\\nexposure to ticks by staying on trails when walking\\nB\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 433\\nGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 433'),\n",

The infection, which\\noccurs almost exclusively in patients with AIDS, can be\\na complication of cat-scratch disease.\\nDescription\\nBacillary angiomatosis is a re-emerging bacterial\\ninfection that is identical or closely related to one which\\ncommonly afflicted thousands of soldiers during World\\nWar I. Today, the disease, caused by two versions of the\\nKEY TERMS\\nAnemia—A below normal number of red blood\\ncells in the bloodstream.\\nParasite—An organism that lives upon or within\\nanother organism.\\nsame bacteria, is linked to homeless AIDS patients and to\\nthose afflicted with cat-scratch disease.\\nThe infection is rarely seen today in patients who\\ndon’t have HIV . According to the U.S. Centers for Dis-\\nease Control and Prevention (CDC), an HIV patient diag-\\nnosed with bacillary angiomatosis is considered to have\\nprogressed to full-blown AIDS.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nScientists have recently isolated two varieties of the\\nBartonella bacteria as the cause of bacillary angiomato-\\nsis:Bartonella (formerly Rochalimaeaquintana ) and B.\\nhenselae (cause of cat-scratch disease).\\nB. quintana infection is known popularly as trench\\nfever, and is the infection associated with body lice that\\nsickened European troops during World War I. Lice carry\\nthe bacteria, and can transmit the infection to humans.\\nThe incidence of trench fever was believed to have faded\\naway with the end of World War I. It was not diagnosed\\nin the United States until 1992, when 10 cases were\\nreported among homeless Seattle men.\\nThe related bacteria B. henselae was first identified\\nseveral years ago as the cause of cat-scratch fever. It also\\ncan lead to bacillary angiomatosis in AIDS patients.\\nBacillary angiomatosis caused by this bacteria is trans-\\nmitted to AIDS patients from cat fleas.\\nThese two different types of bacteria both cause\\nbacillary angiomatosis, a disease which is characterized\\nby wildly proliferating blood vessels that form tumor-like\\nmasses in the skin and organs. The nodules that appear in\\nbacillary angiomatosis are firm and don’t turn white when\\npressed. The lesions can occur anywhere on the body, in\\nnumbers ranging from one to 100. They are rarely found\\non palms of the hands, soles of the feet, or in the mouth.\\nAs the number of lesions increase, the patient may devel-\\nop a high fever, sweats, chills, poor appetite, vomiting,\\nand weight loss. If untreated, infection may be fatal.\\nIn addition to the basic disease process, the two dif-\\nferent types of bacteria cause some slightly different\\nsymptoms. Patients infected with B. henselae also expe-\\nrience blood-filled cysts within the liver and abnormal\\nliver function, whereas B. quintana patients may have\\ntumor growths in the bone.\\nDiagnosis\\nThis life-threatening but curable infection is often\\nmisdiagnosed, because it may be mistaken for other con-\\nditions (such as Kaposi’s sarcoma). A blood test devel-\\noped in 1992 by the CDC detects antibodies to the bacte-\\nria.

This may occur through a wound or infection, or\\nthrough a surgical procedure or injection. Bacteremia\\nmay cause no symptoms and resolve without treatment,\\nor it may produce fever and other symptoms of infection.\\nIn some cases, bacteremia leads to septic shock, a poten-\\ntially life-threatening condition.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nSeveral types of bacteria live on the surface of the\\nskin or colonize the moist linings of the urinary tract,\\nlower digestive tract, and other internal surfaces. These\\nbacteria are normally harmless as long as they are kept in\\ncheck by the body’s natural barriers and the immune sys-\\ntem. People in good health with strong immune systems\\nrarely develop bacteremia. However, when bacteria are\\nintroduced directly into the circulatory system, especial-\\nly in a person who is ill or undergoing aggressive med-\\nical treatment, the immune system may not be able to\\ncope with the invasion, and symptoms of bacteremia may\\ndevelop. For this reason, bacteremia is most common in\\npeople who are already affected by or being treated for\\nsome other medical problem. In addition, medical treat-\\nment may bring a person in contact with new types of\\nbacteria that are more invasive than those already resid-\\ning in that person’s body, further increasing the likeli-\\nhood of bacterial infection.\\nConditions which increase the chances of develop-\\ning bacteremia include:\\n• immune suppression, either due to HIV infection or\\ndrug therapy\\n• antibiotic therapy which changes the balance of bacteri-\\nal types in the body\\n• prolonged or severe illness\\n• alcoholism or other drug abuse\\n• malnutrition\\n• diseases or drug therapy that cause ulcers in the\\nintestines, e.g. chemotherapy for cancer\\nCommon immediate causes of bacteremia include:\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 435\\nBacteremia\\nGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 435'),\n",

Since bacteremia is usually associated with\\nan existing infection elsewhere in the body, finding and\\ntreating this infection is an important part of treatment.\\nBacteremia may cause no symptoms, but may be dis-\\ncovered through a blood test for another condition.

Bad breath, either real or imagined,\\ncan have a significant impact on a person’s social and\\nprofessional life.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nBad breath can be caused by a number of problems.\\nOral diseases, fermentation of food particles in the\\nmouth, sinus infections, and unclean dentures can all\\ncontribute to mouth odor. Many non-oral diseases, such\\nas lung infections, kidney failure, or severe liver disease,\\ncan also cause bad breath, though rarely. Many people\\nthink that bad breath can originate in the stomach or\\nintestines; this is extremely rare. The esophagus is usual-\\nly collapsed and closed, and, although a belch may carry\\nodor up from the stomach, the chance of bad breath\\nbeing caused from air continually escaping from the\\nstomach is remote. Cigarette smoke can cause bad\\nbreath, not only in the cigarette smoker, but also in one\\nwho is constantly exposed to second-hand smoke.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe easiest way to determine if one has bad breath is\\nto ask someone who is trustworthy and discrete. This is\\nusually not too difficult. Another, more private, method of\\ndetermining if one has bad breath is to lick one’s wrist,\\nwait until it dries, then smell the area. Scraping the rear\\narea of the tongue with a plastic spoon, then smelling the\\nspoon, is another method one can use to assess bad breath.\\nKEY TERMS\\nHalitosis—The medical term for bad breath.\\nTreatment\\nThe most effective treatment of bad breath is to treat\\nthe cause. Poor oral hygiene can be improved by regular\\nbrushing and flossing, as well as regular dental checkups.\\nGentle brushing of the tongue should be part of daily oral\\nhygiene. In addition to good oral hygiene, the judicious\\nuse of mouthwashes is helpful. Mouth dryness, experi-\\nenced at night or during fasting, or due to certain med-\\nications and medical conditions, can contribute to bad\\nbreath. Dryness can be avoided by drinking adequate\\namounts of water. Chewing gum may be beneficial.\\nAs mentioned, some medications, such as some high\\nblood pressure medications, can cause dry mouth. If this\\nproblem is significant, a medication change, under the\\nsupervision of one’s health care provider, may improve\\nthe dry-mouth condition. Oral or sinus infections, once\\ndiagnosed, can be treated medically, usually with antibi-\\notics. Lung infections and kidney or liver problems will,\\nof course, need medical treatment\\nAlternative treatment\\nDepending on the cause, a multitude of alternative\\ntherapeutic remedies can be used. For example, sinusitis\\ncan be treated with steam inhalation of essential oils\\nand/or herbs.\\nPrognosis\\nMost bad breath can be treated successfully with\\ngood oral hygiene and/or medical care. Occasionally, for\\npatients who feel that these therapies are unsuccessful,\\nsome delusional or obsessive behavior pattern might per-\\ntain, and mental health counseling may be appropriate.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBerkow, Robert, ed.

Coordi-\\nnation is the capacity to move through a complex set of\\nmovements. Balance and coordination depend on the\\ninteraction of multiple body organs and systems includ-\\ning the eyes, ears, brain and nervous system, cardiovas-\\ncular system, and muscles. Tests or examination of any\\nor all of these organs or systems may be necessary to\\ndetermine the causes of loss of balance,dizziness, or the\\ninability to coordinate movement or activities.\\nPurpose\\nTests of balance and coordination, and the examina-\\ntion of the organs and systems that influence balance and\\ncoordination, can help to identify causes of dizziness,\\nfainting, falling, or incoordination.\\nPrecautions\\nTests for balance and coordination should be con-\\nducted in a safe and controlled area where patients will\\nnot experience injury if they become dizzy or fall.\\nDescription\\nAssessment of balance and coordination can include\\ndiscussion of the patient’s medical history and a com-\\nplete physical examination including evaluation of the\\nheart, head, eyes, and ears. A slow pulse or heart rate, or\\nvery low blood pressure may indicate a circulatory sys-\\ntem problem, which can cause dizziness or fainting. Dur-\\ning the examination, the patient may be asked to rotate\\nthe head from side to side while sitting up or while lying\\ndown with the head and neck extended over the edge of\\nthe examination table. If these tests produce dizziness or\\na rapid twitching of the eyeballs (nystagmus ), the\\npatient may have a disorder of the inner ear, which is\\nresponsible for maintaining balance.\\nAn examination of the eyes and ears may also give\\nclues to episodes of dizziness or incoordination. The\\npatient may be asked to focus on a light or on a distant\\npoint or object, and to look up, down, left, and right mov-\\ning only the eyes while the eyes are examined. Problems\\nwith vision may, in themselves, contribute to balance and\\ncoordination disturbances, or may indicate more serious\\nproblems of the nervous system or brain function. Hear-\\ning loss , fluid in the inner ear, or ear infection might\\nindicate the cause of balance and coordination problems.\\nVarious physical tests may also be used. A patient\\nmay be asked to walk a straight line, stand on one foot,\\nor touch a finger to the nose to help assess balance. The\\npatient may be asked to squeeze or push against the\\ndoctor’s hands, to squat down, to bend over, stand on\\ntiptoes or stand on their heels. Important aspects of\\nthese tests include holding positions for a certain num-\\nber of seconds, successfully repeating movements a\\ncertain number of times, and repeating the test accu-\\nrately with eyes closed. The patient’s reflexes may also\\nbe tested. For example, the doctor may tap on the knees,\\nankles, and elbows with a small rubber mallet to test\\nnervous system functioning.

These\\nare men who have a foreskin, which is the “hood” of soft\\nskin that partially covers the head of the penis. In balanitis,\\nthe head and foreskin become red and inflamed. (In circum-\\ncised men, who lack a foreskin, these symptoms only affect\\nthe tip of the penis.) The condition often occurs due to the\\nfungus Candida albicans, the same organism that causes\\nvaginal yeast infections in women. Balanitis (which is also\\nreferred to as balanoposthitis) can be caused by a variety of\\nother fungal or bacterial infections, or may occur due to a\\nsensitivity reaction to common chemical agents.\\nUncircumcised men are more at risk for balanitis\\ndue to the presence of the foreskin. The snug fit of the\\nforeskin around the top of the penis tends to create a\\ndamp, warm environment that encourages the growth of\\nmicroorganisms. Most of the organisms associated with\\nbalanitis are already present on the penis, but in very\\nsmall numbers. However, if the area between the head\\nand foreskin is not cleansed thoroughly on a regular\\nbasis, these organisms can multiply and lead to infection.\\nDiabetes can increase the risk of developing the con-\\ndition.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nBalanitis is usually a result of poor hygiene—for\\nexample, neglecting to bathe for several days.

In other cases, bal-\\nanitis may occur due to an allergic reaction: Some men\\nmay be sensitive to chemicals found in harsh soaps, laun-\\ndry detergents, or contraceptive creams. Men who con-\\ntract a sexually transmitted disease (STD) such as\\ntrichimoniasis may also develop symptoms.\\nThe symptoms of balanitis are limited to the fore-\\nskin and head of the penis (in circumcised men, only the\\nhead is affected). These include redness, inflammation,\\npain, discharge, sore or itchy skin, and difficulty retract-\\ning the foreskin.\\nDiagnosis\\nBalanitis is usually diagnosed based on a brief physi-\\ncal examination. This may be conducted by your regular\\nhealth care provider or by a urologist, the type of doctor\\nwho specializes in such disorders. The doctor may take a\\nsample of the discharge (if any) to determine the nature of\\nthe possible infection. A urine test may be recommended\\nto evaluate glucose (sugar) levels in the urine. Balanitis\\ntreatment is typically covered by medical insurance.\\nTreatment\\nThe treatment of balanitis depends on the specific\\ncause, which can vary from case to case. Antibiotics are\\nused to treat bacterial infections, while topical antifun-\\ngals such as clotrimazole can combat balanitis caused by\\nCandida. If an allergic reaction is causing symptoms, the\\ngoal is to identify the chemical agent responsible. Oint-\\nments or creams may be used to ease skin irritation.\\nNo matter what the cause, it is important to thor-\\noughly clean the penis on a daily basis in order to allevi-\\nate symptoms. If the condition keeps occurring, or if the\\ninflammation is interfering with urination,circumcision\\nmay be advised.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAccording to practitioners of alternative medicine,\\ncertain herbs may be effective in controlling or prevent-\\ning yeast infections—a common cause of balanitis.\\nThese remedies include garlic, calendula, and gold-\\nenseal. Eating yogurt that contains acidophilus may also\\nhelp to clear up a Candida infection.\\nPrognosis\\nMost cases go away quickly once the cause is identi-\\nfied and treated. However, regular bouts of balanitis can\\nresult in urethral stricture.\\nKEY TERMS\\nAcidophilus—A bacteria believed to combat yeast\\ninfections.\\nCircumcision —The surgical removal of the fore-\\nskin.\\nUrethral stricture —A narrowing of the urethra\\n(urine tube).\\nPrevention\\nProper hygiene is the best way to avoid balanitis.\\nCircumcision is sometimes performed to prevent repeat-\\ned cases.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nSmith, Donald R.

It is primarily a\\ndisease of the tropics, although it is also found in cooler,\\ntemperate climates. Most persons with balantidiasis do\\nnot exhibit any noticeable symptoms (asymptomatic),\\nbut a few individuals will develop diarrhea with blood\\nand mucus and an inflamed colon (colitis).\\nDescription\\nBalantidiasis is caused by Balantidium coli , a para-\\nsitic protozoan that infects the large intestine.

During its life\\ncycle, this organism exists in two very different forms: the\\ninfective cyst or capsuled form, which cannot move but\\ncan survive outside the human body because of its thick,\\nprotective covering; and the disease-producing form, the\\ntrophozoite, which although capable of moving, cannot\\nsurvive once excreted in the feces and, therefore, cannot\\ninfect others. In the digestive tract, the cysts are transport-\\ned to the intestine where the walls of the cysts are broken\\nopen by digestive secretions, releasing the mobile tropho-\\nzoites. Once released within the intestine, the tropho-\\nzoites multiply by feeding on intestinal bacteria or by\\ninvading the lining of the large intestine. Within the lining\\nof the large intestine, the trophozoites secrete a substance\\nthat destroys intestinal tissue and creates sores (ulcers) or\\nabscesses. Trophozoites eventually form new cysts that\\nare carried through the digestive tract and excreted in the\\nfeces. Under favorable temperature and humidity condi-\\ntions, the cysts can survive in soil or water for weeks to\\nmonths, ready to begin the cycle again.\\nMost individuals with balantidiasis have no notice-\\nable symptoms. Even though these individuals may not\\nfeel ill, they are still capable of infecting others by per-\\nson-to-person contact or by contaminating food or water\\nwith cysts that others may ingest, for example, by prepar-\\ning food with unwashed hands.\\nThe most common symptoms of balantidiasis are\\nchronic diarrhea or severe colitis with abdominal cramps,\\npain, and bloody stools. Complications may include\\nintestinal perforation in which the intestinal wall\\nbecomes torn, but the organisms do not spread to other\\nparts of the body in the blood stream.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of balantidiasis, as with other similar dis-\\neases, can be complicated, partly because symptoms may\\nor may not be present. A diagnosis of balantidiasis may be\\nconsidered when a patient has diarrhea combined with a\\npossible history of recent exposure to amebiasis through\\ntravel, contact with infected persons, or anal intercourse.\\nSpecifically, a diagnosis of balantidiasis is made by\\nfinding B. coli cysts or trophozoites in the patient’s stools\\nor by finding trophozoites in tissue samples (biopsy)\\ntaken from the large bowel. A diagnostic blood test has\\nnot yet been developed.\\nStool examination\\nThis test involves microscopically examining a stool\\nsample for the presence of cysts and/or trophozoites of B.\\ncoli.\\nSigmoidoscopy\\nTo take a tissue sample from the large intestine, a\\nprocedure called a sigmoidoscopy is performed. During\\na sigmoidoscopy, a thin, flexible instrument is used to\\nvisually examine the intestinal lining and obtain small\\ntissue specimens.\\nTreatment\\nPatients with balantidiasis are treated with prescrip-\\ntion medication, typically consisting of a ten day course\\nof either tetracycline or metronidazole. Alternative drugs\\nthat have proven effective in treating balantidiasis\\ninclude iodoquinol or paromomycin.\\nPrognosis\\nAlthough somewhat dependent on the patient’s over-\\nall health, in general, the prognosis for most patients with\\nbalantidiasis is good. Severely infected patients occa-\\nsionally die as a result of a tear in the intestinal wall\\n(intestinal perforation) and consequent loss of blood.\\nPrevention\\nThere are no immunization procedures or medica-\\ntions that can be taken prior to potential exposure to pre-\\nvent balantidiasis. Moreover, people who have had the\\ndisease can become reinfected. Prevention requires effec-\\ntive personal and community hygiene. Specific safe-\\nguards include the following:\\n• Purification of drinking water. Water can be purified by\\nfiltering, boiling, or treatment with iodine.\\n• Proper food handling. Measures include protecting\\nfood from contamination by flies, cooking food proper-\\nly, washing one’s hands after using the bathroom and\\nbefore cooking or eating, and avoiding foods that can-\\nnot be cooked or peeled when traveling in countries\\nwith high rates of balantidiasis.\\n• Careful disposal of human feces.\\n• Monitoring the contacts of balantidiasis patients. The\\nstools of family members and sexual partners of infect-\\ned persons should be tested for the presence of cysts or\\ntrophozoites.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 441\\nBalantidiasis\\nGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 441'),\n",

They\\nare called aortic valve, pulmonary valve, mitral valve,\\nand tricuspid valve. The valves open and close to regu-\\nlate the blood flow from one chamber to the next. They\\nare vital to the efficient functioning of the heart.\\nIn some people the valves are too narrow (a condi-\\ntion called stenosis). Balloon valvuloplasty is performed\\non children and adults to improve valve function and\\nblood flow by enlarging the valve opening. It is a treat-\\nment for aortic, mitral, and pulmonary stenosis. Balloon\\nvalvuloplasty has the best results as a treatment for nar-\\nrowed pulmonary valves. Results in treating narrowing\\nof the mitral valve are generally good. It is more difficult\\nto perform and less successful in treating narrowing of\\nthe aortic valve.\\nDescription\\nBalloon valvuloplasty is a procedure in which a thin\\ntube (catheter) that has a small deflated balloon at the tip\\nis inserted through the skin in the groin area into a blood\\nvessel, and then is threaded up to the opening of the nar-\\nrowed heart valve. The balloon is inflated, which stretch-\\nes the valve open. This procedure cures many valve\\nobstructions. It is also called balloon enlargement of a\\nnarrowed heart valve.\\nThe procedure is performed in a cardiac catheteriza-\\ntion laboratory and takes up to four hours. The patient is\\nusually awake, but is given local anesthesia to make the area\\nwhere the catheter is inserted numb. After the site where the\\ncatheter will be inserted is prepared and anesthetized, the\\ncardiologist inserts a catheter into the appropriate blood ves-\\nsel, then passes a balloon-tipped catheter through the first\\ncatheter. Guided by a video monitor and an x ray, the physi-\\ncian slowly threads the catheter into the heart. The deflated\\nballoon is positioned in the valve opening, then is inflated\\nrepeatedly. The inflated balloon widens the valve’s opening\\nby splitting the valve leaflets apart. Once the valve is\\nwidened, the balloon-tipped catheter is removed. The other\\ncatheter remains in place for 6 to 12 hours because in some\\ncases the procedure must be repeated.\\nPreparation\\nFor at least six hours before balloon valvuloplasty,\\nthe patient will have to avoid eating or drinking anything.\\nAn intravenous line is inserted so that medications can be\\nadministered. The patient’s groin area is shaved and\\ncleaned with an antiseptic. About an hour before the pro-\\ncedure, the patient is given an oral sedative such as\\ndiazepam (Valium).\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2442\\nBalloon valvuloplasty\\nGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 442'),\n",

An electrocardiogram, which is a record of the\\nelectrical impulses in the heart, is done. The leg in which\\nthe catheter was inserted is temporarily prevented from\\nmoving. The skin condition is monitored. The insertion\\nsite, which will be covered by a sandbag, is observed for\\nbleeding until the catheter is removed. Intravenous fluids\\nwill be given to help eliminate the x-ray dye; intravenous\\nblood thinners or other medications to dilate the coronary\\narteries may be given.

Brain injury may be\\ncaused by an accidental head injury or a medical condi-\\ntion, such as stroke, tumor, or infection. When the brain\\nis injured, fluids accumulate in the brain, causing it to\\nswell. The skull does not allow for the expansion of the\\nbrain; in effect, the brain becomes compressed.\\nIf the pressure does not abate, oxygenated blood\\nmay not reach all areas of the brain.

There are two types of this test:\\nthe single-contrast technique where barium sulfate is\\ninjected into the rectum in order to gain a profile view of\\nthe large intestine; and the double-contrast (or “air con-\\ntrast”) technique where air is inserted into the rectum.\\nPurpose\\nA barium enema may be performed for a variety of\\nreasons, including to aid in the diagnosis of colon and\\nrectal cancer(or colorectal cancer), and inflammatory\\ndisease. Detection of polyps (a benign growth in the tis-\\nsue lining of the colon and rectum), diverticula (a pouch\\npushing out from the colon), and structural changes in\\nthe large intestine can also be established with this test.\\nThe double-contrast barium enema is the best method for\\ndetecting small tumors (such as polyps), early inflamma-\\ntory disease, and bleeding caused by ulcers.\\nThe decision to perform a barium enema is based on a\\nperson’s history of altered bowel habits. These can include\\ndiarrhea, constipation, any lower abdominal pain they\\nare currently exhibiting, blood, mucus, or pus in their\\nstools. It is also recommended that this exam be used every\\nfive to 10 years to screen healthy people for colorectal can-\\ncer, the second most deadly type of tumor in the United\\nStates.

As of 1997, some studies have shown\\nthat the colonoscopy procedure performed by experi-\\nenced gastroenterologists is a more accurate initial diag-\\nnostic tool for detecting early signs of colorectal cancer.\\nA colonoscopy is the most accurate way for the physi-\\ncian to examine the entire colon and rectum for polyps. If\\nabnormalities are seen at this time the procedure is\\naccompanied by a biopsy. Some physicians use sigmoi-\\ndoscopy plus a barium enema instead of colonoscopy.\\nDescription\\nTo begin a barium enema, the patient will lie with\\ntheir back down on a tilting radiographic table in order to\\nhave x rays of the abdomen taken. After being assisted to\\na different position, a well-lubricated rectal tube is insert-\\ned through the anus. This tube allows the physician or\\nassistant to slowly administer the barium into the intes-\\ntine. While this filling process is closely monitored, it is\\nimportant for the patient to keep the anus tightly con-\\ntracted against the rectal tube to help maintain its posi-\\ntion and prevent the barium from leaking. This step is\\nemphasized to the patient due to the inaccuracy that may\\nbe caused if the barium leaks. A rectal balloon may also\\nbe inflated to help retain the barium. The table may be\\ntilted or the patient moved to a different position to aid in\\nthe filling process.\\nAs the barium fills the intestine, x rays of the abdomen\\nare taken to distinguish significant findings.There are many\\nways to perform a barium enema. One way is that shortly\\nafter filling, the rectal tube is removed and the patient\\nexpels as much of the barium as possible. Upon completing\\nthis, an additional x ray is taken,and a double-contrast\\nenema may follow. If this is done immediately, a thin\\nfilm of barium will remain in the intestine, and air is\\nthen slowly injected to expand the bowel lumen.\\nSometimes no x rays will be taken until after the air is\\ninjected.\\nPreparation\\nIn order to conduct the most accurate barium enema\\ntest, the patient must follow a prescribed diet and bowel\\npreparation instructions prior to the test. This preparation\\ncommonly includes restricted intake of diary products\\nand a liquid diet for 24 hours prior to the test, in addition\\nto drinking large amounts of water or clear liquids 12–24\\nhours before the test. Patients may also be given laxa-\\ntives, and asked to give themselves a cleansing enema.\\nIn addition to the prescribed diet and bowel prepara-\\ntion prior to the test, the patient can expect the following\\nduring a barium enema:\\n• They will be well draped with a gown as they are\\nsecured to a tilting x-ray table.\\n• As the barium or air is injected into the intestine, they\\nmay experience cramping pains or the urge to defecate.\\n• The patient will be instructed to take slow, deep breaths\\nthrough the mouth to ease any discomfort.\\nAftercare\\nPatients should follow several steps immediately\\nafter undergoing a barium enema, including:\\n• Drink plenty of fluids to help counteract the dehydrat-\\ning effects of bowel preparation and the test.\\n• Take time to rest. A barium enema and the bowel prepa-\\nration taken before it can be exhausting.\\n• A cleansing enema may be given to eliminate any\\nremaining barium. Lightly colored stools will be preva-\\nlent for the next 24-72 hours following the test.\\nRisks\\nWhile a barium enema is considered a safe screen-\\ning test used on a routine basis, it can cause complica-\\ntions in certain people. The following indications should\\nbe kept in mind before a barium enema is performed:\\n• Those who have a rapid heart rate, severe ulcerative\\ncolitis, toxic megacolon, or a presumed perforation in\\nthe intestine should not undergo a barium enema.\\n• The test can be cautiously performed if the patient has a\\nblocked intestine, ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis, or\\nsevere bloody diarrhea.\\n• Complications that may be caused by the test include\\nperforation of the colon, water intoxication, barium\\ngranulomas (inflamed nodules), and allergic reaction.\\nThese are all very rare.\\nNormal results\\nWhen the patient undergoes a single-contrast enema,\\ntheir intestine is steadily filled with barium to differenti-\\nate the colon’s markings. A normal result displays uni-\\nform filling of the colon. As the barium is expelled, the\\nintestinal walls collapse. A normal result on the x ray\\nafter defecation will show the intestinal lining as having\\na standard, feathery appearance.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2448\\nBarium enema\\nGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 448'),\n",

The disease is transmitted by\\nsandflies and occurs in western South America. Charac-\\nterized by a form of red blood cell deficiency (hemolytic\\nanemia) and fever, the potentially fatal acute form is\\ncalled Oroya fever or Carrion’s disease. The chronic\\nform is identified by painful skin lesions.\\nDescription\\nThe acute form of the disease gets its name from an\\noutbreak that occurred in 1871 near La Oroya, Peru.\\nKEY TERMS\\nAcute—Referring to the course of a disease, or a\\nphase of a disease, the short-term experience of\\nprominent symptoms.\\nChronic—Referring to the course of a disease, or a\\nphase of a disease, the long-term experience of\\nprominent symptoms.\\nErythrocytes—Red blood cells.\\nHemolytic anemia—A form of erythrocyte deficien-\\ncy caused by the destruction of the red blood cells.\\nHost—The organism that harbors or nourishes\\nanother organism (parasite). In bartonellosis, the\\nperson infected with Bartonella basilliformis.\\nVector—An organism, such as insects or rodents,\\nthat can transmit disease to humans.\\nMore than 7,000 people perished. Some survivors later\\ndeveloped a skin disease, called verruga peruana (Peru-\\nvian warts). These skin lesions were observed prior to\\nthe 1871 outbreak—perhaps as far back as the pre-\\nColumbian era—but a connection to Oroya fever was\\nunknown. In 1885, a young medical researcher, Daniel\\nCarrion, inoculated himself with blood from a lesion to\\nstudy the course of the skin disease. When he became ill\\nwith Oroya fever, the connection became apparent.\\nOroya fever is often called Carrion’s disease in honor of\\nhis fatal experiment.\\nThe bacteria, Bartonella bacilliformis , was isolated\\nby Alberto Barton in 1909, but wasn’t identified as the\\ncause of the fever until 1940. The Bartonella genus\\nincludes at least 11 bacteria species, four of which cause\\nhuman diseases, including cat-scratch disease and\\nbacillary angiomatosis . However, bartonellosis refers\\nexclusively to the disease caused by B. bacilliformis. The\\ndisease is limited to a small area of the Andes Mountains\\nin western South America; nearly all cases have been in\\nPeru, Colombia, and Ecuador. A large outbreak involving\\nthousands of people occurred in 1940–41, but bartonel-\\nlosis has since occurred sporadically. Control of sand-\\nflies, the only known disease carrier (vector), has been\\ncredited with managing the disease.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nBartonellosis is transmitted by the nocturnal sandfly\\nand arises from infection with B. bacilliformis.

Although most children\\nbetween the ages of three and five begin to stay dry at\\nnight, the age at which children are physically and emo-\\ntionally ready to maintain complete bladder control\\nvaries. Enuresis is a technical term that refers to the con-\\ntinued, usually involuntary, passage of urine during the\\nnight or the day after the age at which control is expected.\\nDescription\\nMost children wet the bed occasionally, and defini-\\ntions of the age and frequency at which bed-wetting\\nbecomes a medical problem vary somewhat. Many\\nresearchers consider bed-wetting normal until age 6.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 453\\nBed-wetting\\nGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 453'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 467}, page_content='About 10% of 6-year-old children wet the bed about\\nonce a month. More boys than girls have this problem.\\nThe American Psychiatric Association, however, defines\\nenuresis as repeated voiding of urine into the bed or\\nclothes at age five or older. The wetting is usually invol-\\nuntary but in some cases it is intentional. For a diagnosis\\nof enuresis, wetting must occur twice a week for at least\\nthree months with no underlying physiological cause.\\nEnuresis, both nighttime (nocturnal) and daytime (diur-\\nnal), at age five affects 7% of boys and 3% of girls. By\\nage 10, it affects 3% of boys and 2% of girls; only 1% of\\nadolescents experience enuresis.\\nEnuresis is divided into two classes. A child with\\nprimary enuresis has never established bladder control. A\\nchild with secondary enuresis begins to wet after a pro-\\nlonged dry period. Some children have both nocturnal\\nand diurnal enuresis.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe causes of bed-wetting are not entirely known. It\\ntends to run in families. Most children with primary enure-\\nsis have a close relative—a parent, aunt, or uncle—who\\nalso had the disorder. About 70% of children with two par-\\nents who wet the bed will also wet the bed. Twin studies\\nhave shown that both of a pair of identical twins experience\\nenuresis more often than both of a pair of fraternal twins.\\nSometimes bed-wetting can be caused by a serious\\nmedical problem like diabetes, sickle-cell anemia, or\\nepilepsy. Snoring and episodes of interrupted breathing\\nduring sleep ( sleep apnea ) occasionally contribute to\\nbed-wetting problems. Enlarged adenoids can cause\\nthese conditions. Other physiological problems, such as\\nurinary tract infection, severe constipation , or spinal\\ncord injury, can cause bed-wetting.\\nChildren who wet the bed frequently may have a\\nsmaller than normal functional bladder capacity. Func-\\ntional bladder capacity is the amount of urine a person\\ncan hold in the bladder before feeling a strong urge to\\nurinate. When functional capacity is small, the bladder\\nwill not hold all the urine produced during the night.\\nTests have shown that bladder size in these children is\\nnormal. Nevertheless, they experience frequent strong\\nurges to urinate. Such children urinate often during the\\ndaytime and may wet several times at night. Although a\\nsmall functional bladder capacity may be caused by a\\ndevelopmental delay, it may also be that the child’s habit\\nof voiding frequently slows bladder development.\\nParents often report that their bed-wetting child is an\\nextremely sound sleeper and difficult to wake. However,\\nseveral research studies found that bed-wetting children\\nhave normal sleep patterns and that bed-wetting can\\noccur in any stage of sleep.\\nRecent medical research has found that many chil-\\ndren who wet the bed may have a deficiency of an impor-\\ntant hormone known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH).\\nADH helps to concentrate urine during sleep hours,\\nmeaning that the urine contains less water and therefore\\ntakes up less space. This decreased volume of water usu-\\nally prevents the child’s bladder from overfilling during\\nthe night, unless the child drank a lot just before going to\\nbed. Testing of many bed-wetting children has shown\\nthat these children do not have the usual increase in ADH\\nduring sleep. Children who wet the bed, therefore, often\\nproduce more urine during the hours of sleep than their\\nbladders can hold. If they do not wake up, the bladder\\nreleases the excess urine and the child wets the bed.\\nResearch demonstrates that in most cases bed-wet-\\nting does not indicate that the child has a physical or psy-\\nchological problem. Children who wet the bed usually\\nhave normal-sized bladders and have sleep patterns that\\nare no different from those of non-bed-wetting children.\\nSometimes emotional stress, such as the birth of a sib-\\nling, a death in the family, or separation from the family,\\nmay be associated with the onset of bed-wetting in a pre-\\nviously toilet-trained child. Daytime wetting, however,\\nmay indicate that the problem has a physical cause.\\nWhile most children have no long-term problems as\\na result of bed-wetting, some children may develop psy-\\nchological problems. Low self-esteem may occur when\\nthese children, who already feel embarrassed, are further\\nhumiliated by angry or frustrated parents who punish\\nthem or who are overly aggressive about toilet training.\\nThe problem can by aggravated when playmates tease or\\nwhen social activities such as sleep-away camp are\\navoided for fear of teasing.\\nDiagnosis\\nIf a child continues to wet the bed after the age of\\nsix, parents may feel the need to seek evaluation and\\ndiagnosis by the family doctor or a children’s specialist\\n(pediatrician). Typically, before the doctor can make a\\ndiagnosis, a thorough medical history is obtained. Then\\nthe child receives a physical examination , appropriate\\nlaboratory tests, including a urine test ( urinalysis), and,\\nif necessary, radiologic studies (such as x rays).\\nIf the child is healthy and no physical problem is found,\\nwhich is the case 90% of the time, the doctor may not rec-\\nommend treatment but rather may provide the parents and\\nthe child with reassurance, information, and advice.\\nTreatment\\nOccasionally a doctor will determine that the prob-\\nlem is serious enough to require treatment.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 468}, page_content='treatments for bed-wetting include bladder training\\nexercises, motivational therapy, drug therapy, psy-\\nchotherapy, and diet therapy.\\nBladder training exercises are based on the theory\\nthat those who wet the bed have small functional bladder\\ncapacity. Children are told to drink a large quantity of\\nwater and to try to prolong the periods between urina-\\ntions. These exercises are designed to increase bladder\\ncapacity but are only successful in resolving bed-wetting\\nin a small number of patients.\\nIn motivational therapy, parents attempt to encour-\\nage the child to combat bed-wetting, but the child must\\nwant to achieve success. Positive reinforcement, such as\\npraise or rewards for staying dry, can help improve self-\\nimage and resolve the condition. Punishment for “wet”\\nnights will hamper the child’s self-esteem and compound\\nthe problem.\\nThe following motivational techniques are common-\\nly used:\\n• Behavior modification. This method of therapy is\\naimed at helping children take responsibility for their\\nnighttime bladder control by teaching new behaviors.\\nFor example, children are taught to use the bathroom\\nbefore bedtime and to avoid drinking fluids after din-\\nner. While behavior modification generally produces\\ngood results, it is long-term treatment.\\n• Alarms. This form of therapy uses a sensor placed in\\nthe child’s pajamas or in a bed pad. This sensor triggers\\nan alarm that wakes the child at the first sign of wet-\\nness. If the child is awakened, he or she can then go to\\nthe bathroom and finish urinating. The intention is to\\ncondition a response to awaken when the bladder is\\nfull. Bed-wetting alarms require the motivation of both\\nparents and children. They are considered the most\\neffective form of treatment now available.\\nA number of drugs are also used to treat bed-wetting.\\nThese medications are usually fast acting; children often\\nrespond to them within the first week of treatment. Among\\nthe drugs commonly used are a nasal spray of desmo-\\npressin acetate (DDA VP), a substance similar to the hor-\\nmone that helps regulate urine production; and imipramine\\nhydrochloride, a drug that helps to increase bladder capac-\\nity. Studies show that imipramine is effective for as many\\nas 50% of patients. However, children often wet the bed\\nagain after the drug is discontinued, and it has some side\\neffects. Some bed-wetting with an underlying physical\\ncause can be treated by surgical procedures. These causes\\ninclude enlarged adenoids that cause sleep apnea, physical\\ndefects in the urinary system, or a spinal tumor.\\nPsychotherapy is indicated when the child exhibits\\nsigns of severe emotional distress in response to events\\nsuch as a death in the family, the birth of a new child, a\\nchange in schools, or divorce. Psychotherapy is also indi-\\ncated if a child shows signs of persistently low self-\\nesteem or depression.\\nIn rare cases, allergies or intolerances to certain\\nfoods—such as dairy products, citrus products, or choco-\\nlate—can cause bed-wetting. When children have food\\nsensitivities, bed-wetting may be helped by discovering\\nthe substances that trigger the allergic response and elim-\\ninating these substances from the child’s diet.\\nAlternative treatment\\nA number of alternative treatments are available for\\nbed-wetting.\\nMassage\\nAccording to practitioners of this technique, pres-\\nsure applied to various points on the body may help alle-\\nviate the condition. Acupressure or massage, when done\\nby a trained therapist, may also be helpful in bed-wetting\\ncaused by a neurologic problem.\\nHerbal and homeopathic remedies\\nSome herbal remedies, such as horsetail ( Equisetum\\narvense ) have also been used to treat bed-wetting. A\\ntrained homeopathic practitioner, working at the consti-\\ntutional level, will seek to rebalance the child’s vital\\nforce, eliminating the imbalanced behavior of bed-wet-\\nting. Common homeopathic remedies used in this treat-\\nment include Causticum, Lycopodium, and Pulsatilla.\\nHypnosis\\nHypnosis is another approach that is being used suc-\\ncessfully by practitioners trained in this therapy. It trains\\nthe child to awaken and go to the bathroom when his or\\nher bladder feels full. Hypnosis is less expensive, less\\ntime-consuming, and less dangerous than most\\napproaches; it has virtually no side effects. Recent med-\\nical studies show that hypnotherapy can work quickly—\\nwithin four to six sessions.\\nPrognosis\\nOccasional bed-wetting is not a disease and it does\\nnot have a “cure.” If the child has no underlying physical\\nor psychological problem that is causing the bed-wetting,\\nin most cases he or she will outgrow the condition with-\\nout treatment. About 15% of bedwetters become dry each\\nyear after age 6.

Marked improvement\\nis seen in about 75% of cases treated with wetness alarms.\\nPrevention\\nAlthough preventing a child from wetting the bed is\\nnot always possible, parents can take steps to help the\\nchild keep the bed dry at night. These steps include:\\n• Encouraging and praising the child for staying dry\\ninstead of punishing when the child wets.\\n• Reminding the child to urinate before going to bed, if\\nhe or she feels the need.\\n• Limiting liquid intake at least two hours before bed-\\ntime.\\nKEY TERMS\\nAcupressure—A technique using pressure to vari-\\nous points on the body to alleviate health prob-\\nlems.\\nADH—Antidiuretic hormone, or the hormone that\\nhelps to concentrate urine during the night.\\nBehavior modification—Techniques used to change\\nharmful behavior patterns.\\nBladder —The muscular sac or container that\\nstores urine until it is released from the body\\nthrough the tube that carries urine from the blad-\\nder to the outside of the body (urethra).\\nDDAVP—Desmopressin acetate, a drug used to\\nregulate urine production.\\nHypnosis—The technique by which a trained pro-\\nfessional relaxes the subject and then asks ques-\\ntions or gives suggestions.\\nImipramine hydrochloride —A drug used to\\nincrease bladder capacity.\\nKidneys—A pair of organs located on each side of\\nthe spine in the lower back area.

An\\ninfection-fighting rinse can be made by diluting two\\ndrops of essential tea tree oil (Melaleuca spp.) in eight\\nounces of water.

Calendula cream can also be used.\\nContrasting hot and cold local applications can\\nincrease circulation to the area and help flush out waste\\nproducts, speeding the healing process. The temperatures\\nshould be extreme (hot hot and ice cold), yet tolerable to\\nthe skin. Hot compresses should be applied for three\\nminutes, followed by 30 seconds of cold compress appli-\\ncation, repeating the cycle three times. The cycle should\\nalways end with the cold compress.\\nPrevention\\nIt is usually possible to prevent bedsores from devel-\\noping or worsening. The patient should be inspected reg-\\nularly; should bathe or shower every day, using warm\\nwater and mild soap; and should avoid cold or dry air. A\\nbedridden patient should be repositioned at least once\\nevery two hours while awake. A person who uses a\\nwheelchair should shift his weight every 10 or 15 min-\\nutes, or be helped to reposition himself at least once an\\nhour. It is important to lift, rather than drag, a person\\nbeing repositioned. Bony parts of the body should not be\\nmassaged.

These symptoms include ulceration\\nof the mouth or the genital area,skin lesions, and inflam-\\nmation of the uvea (an area around the pupil of the eye).\\nDescription\\nBehcet’s syndrome is a chronic disease that involves\\nmultiple body systems. The disease is named for a Turk-\\nish dermatologist, Hulusi Behcet, who first reported a\\npatient with recurrent mouth and genital ulcers along\\nwith uveitis in 1937. The disease occurs worldwide, but\\nis most prevalent in Japan, the Middle East, and in the\\nMediterranean region. There is a wider prevalence\\namong males than females in a ratio of two to one.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe cause of Behcet’s syndrome is unknown. Symp-\\ntoms include recurring ulcers in the mouth or the genital\\narea, skin lesions, arthritis that affects mainly the knees\\nand ankles,pain and irritation in the eyes, and fever. The\\nmouth and genital ulcers tend to occur in multiples and\\ncan be quite painful. In the mouth, these ulcers are gener-\\nally found on the tongue, gums, and the inside of the lips\\nor jaws. In the genital area, the ulcers usually occur on\\nthe penis and scrotum in males and on the vulva of\\nwomen. The eye inflammation can lead to blindness.\\nDiagnosis\\nBecause Behcet’s syndrome is a multisystem disease,\\nit is difficult to diagnose. International criteria have been\\nproposed to assist in classifying this disease. There is no\\none diagnostic feature of this disease, so diagnosis depends\\non grouping together enough symptoms in order to identify\\nthe disease. Symptoms of Behcet’s syndrome also occur in\\nother diseases, so it is often necessary to rule out the other\\ndiseases before a definitive diagnosis can be reached.\\nTreatment\\nSome of the current drugs used to treat Behcet’s syn-\\ndrome include:\\n• corticosteroids\\n• cyclosporin\\n• azathioprine\\n• chlorambucil\\n• interferon alpha\\n• thalidomide\\n• levamisole\\n• pulse cyclophosphamide\\n• cyclosporine\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for Behcet’s syndrome is generally\\npoor. There has been a documented case of Behcet’s last-\\ning for 17 years. Although the disease is considered\\npainful but not fatal, when the central nervous system is\\ninvolved there is usually severe disability and death\\noften occurs. The condition is usually chronic, although\\nthere can be remissions during the course of the disease.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 459\\nBehcet’s syndrome\\nGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 459'),\n",

Unlike the better-known venereal syphilis,\\nendemic syphilis is not a sexually transmitted disease.\\nDescription\\nBejel has many other names depending on the locali-\\nty: siti, dichuchwa, njovera, belesh, and skerljevo are\\nsome of the names. It is most commonly found in the\\nMiddle East (Syria, Saudi Arabia, Iraq), Africa, central\\nAsia, and Australia. Bejel is related to yaws and pinta,\\nbut has different symptoms.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nTreponema pallidum, the bacteria that causes bejel,\\nis very closely related to the one that causes the sexually\\ntransmitted form of syphilis, but transmission is very dif-\\nferent. In bejel, transmission is by direct contact, with\\nbroken skin or contaminated hands, or indirectly by shar-\\ning drinking vessels and eating utensils. T. pallidum is\\npassed on mostly between children living in poverty in\\nvery unsanitary environments and with poor hygiene.\\nThe skin, bones, and mucous membranes are affect-\\ned by bejel. Patches and ulcerated sores are common in\\nthe mouth, throat, and nasal passages. Gummy lesions\\nmay form, even breaking through the palate. Other find-\\nings may include a region of swollen lymph nodes and\\ndeep bone pain in the legs. Eventually, bones may\\nbecome deformed.\\nDiagnosis\\nT. pallidum can be detected by microscopic study of\\nsamples taken from the sores or lymph fluid. However,\\nsince antibody tests don’t distinguish between the types of\\nsyphilis, specific diagnosis of the type of syphilis depends\\non the patient’s history, symptoms, and environment.\\nTreatment\\nLarge doses of benzathine penicillin G given by injec-\\ntion into the muscle can cure this disease in any stage,\\nalthough it may take longer and require additional doses in\\nlater stages. If penicillin cannot be given, the alternative is\\ntetracycline. Since tetracycline can permanently discolor\\nnew teeth still forming, it is usually not prescribed for chil-\\ndren unless no viable alternative is available.\\nPrognosis\\nBejel is completely curable with antibiotic treatment.\\nPrevention\\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has worked\\nwith many countries to prevent this and other diseases, and\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2460\\nBejel\\nGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 460'),\n",

Afflict-\\ned individuals may be unable to close the eye on the\\naffected side of the face, and may also experience tear-\\ning, drooling, and hypersensitive hearing. The onset can\\nbe quite sudden, sometimes occurring overnight.\\nAlthough Bell’s palsy is unsettling and inconvenient, it is\\ntypically not indicative of a serious health problem. The\\nweakness and paralysis resolve completely in the majori-\\nty of cases.\\nDescription\\nBell’s palsy has been described as a diagnosis of\\nexclusion because several other disorders present similar\\nKEY TERMS\\nEndemic disease —An infectious disease that\\noccurs frequently in a specific geographical\\nlocale.

One is\\na sexually transmitted disease caused by a bacte-\\nria. The second form is not sexually transmitted,\\nbut passed on by direct contact with the patient or\\nthrough use of shared food dishes and utensils.\\nsymptoms. Facial palsies have been linked to conditions\\nsuch as Lyme disease , ear infection, meningitis ,\\nsyphilis, German measles (rubella), mumps, chicken-\\npox (varicella), and infection with Epstein-Barr virus\\n(e.g., infectious mononucleosis). True Bell’s palsy is an\\nidiopathic facial palsy, meaning the root cause cannot be\\nidentified. Although Bell’s palsy is not life-threatening, it\\ncan present symptoms similar to truly serious conditions,\\nsuch as a stroke, ruptured aneurysm, or tumors.\\nEvery year, approximately 40,000-65,000 Americans\\nare stricken with Bell’s palsy. Worldwide, there is an\\nannual incidence of 20-30 cases per 100,000 individuals.\\nAn individual can be affected at any age, but young and\\nmiddle-aged adults are the most likely to be affected. It is\\nunusual to see Bell’s palsy in people less than 10 years\\nold. Bell’s palsy can affect either side of the face, and nei-\\nther gender seems to be at a greater risk. Pregnant women\\nand individuals with diabetes,influenza , a cold, or an\\nupper respiratory infection seem to be at a greater risk.\\nAlthough it cannot be considered a serious condition from\\na health standpoint, it can cause extreme stress, embar-\\nrassment, and inconvenience for those affected.\\nIn the large majority of cases (80-85%), the facial\\nweakness or paralysis is temporary. However, individuals\\nwho experience complete paralysis seem to have a poorer\\nrecovery rate with only 60% returning to normal. Approx-\\nimately 4-6% of all Bell’s palsy cases result in permanent\\nfacial deformity, and another 10-15% experience perma-\\nnent problems with spasms, twitching, or contracted mus-\\ncles. Between 2% and 7.3% of individuals who have\\nexperienced Bell’s palsy will have a recurrence. On aver-\\nage, the first recurrence happens 9.8 years after the first\\nepisode; the second, 6.7 years later. One recurrence is\\nvery infrequent, and a second is extremely rare.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe symptoms of Bell’s palsy arise from an inflam-\\nmation or swelling of the seventh cranial nerve, other-\\nwise called the facial nerve. Both sides of the face have a\\nfacial nerve which controls the muscles on that side of\\nthe face. The course of the facial nerve passes through a\\nbony canal in the skull. When the nerve becomes\\nswollen, it is compressed since the canal does not allow\\nfor any expansion. As further swelling increases the com-\\npression, nerve signal conduction is impeded or even\\nprevented. The interference with the nerve signals is seen\\nin the loss of muscle control and tone.\\nWhy the facial nerve becomes inflamed in Bell’s\\npalsy is a matter of some debate, and medical researchers\\nand doctors are not in complete agreement. The best-sup-\\nported evidence implicates the herpes simplex virus\\n(HSV), which is responsible for cold sores and fever\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 461\\nBell’s palsy\\nGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 461'),\n",

Most people harbor this virus,\\nalthough they may not exhibit symptoms.\\nThe major symptom of Bell’s palsy is one-sided\\nfacial weakness or paralysis. Muscle control is either\\ninadequate or completely missing. There may also be\\ninvoluntary facial movements, such as twitches, that\\naccompany certain facial expressions. Afflicted individu-\\nals frequently have difficulty shutting the affected eye\\nand may not be able to close it at all.\\nDiagnosis\\nAlthough Bell’s palsy is not life-threatening, it\\nshares symptoms in common with serious conditions,\\nsuch as stroke. Therefore, emergency medical attention is\\na wise and necessary precaution. Bell’s palsy affects the\\nfacial nerve, unlike most strokes associated with facial\\nweakness which affect higher nerve centers ultimately\\nsupplying the facial nerve. These two disorders can be\\ndistinquished clinically because most strokes do not\\ncause weakness of the forehead or eyelid muscles.\\nThe fact that Bell’s palsy is a diagnosis of exclusion\\nbecomes apparent in the course of the medical examina-\\ntion—the usual mode of examination is to rule out other\\ndisorders until only Bell’s palsy is left. Disorders that\\nneed to be excluded include demyelinating disease (e.g.,\\nmultiple sclerosis), stroke, tumors, bacterial or viral\\ninfection, and bone fracture.\\nDuring the physical examination, the afflicted indi-\\nvidual is asked about recent illnesses, accidents, infec-\\ntions, and any other symptoms. A visual exam of the\\nears, throat, and sinus is done, and hearing is tested. The\\nextent of the symptoms is assessed by grading the sym-\\nmetry of the face at rest and during voluntary move-\\nments, such as wrinkling the forehead, puckering the\\nlips, and closing the affected eye. Involuntary move-\\nments are assessed in combination with the voluntary\\nmovements. Neurologic exam is done to rule out\\ninvolvement of other parts of the nervous system except\\nfor the facial muscles, which would exclude the diagno-\\nsis of Bell’s palsy.\\nIn response to the individual’s medical history,\\nblood tests and possibly a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)\\nanalysis are ordered. The results of these tests help\\ndetermine the presence of a bacterial or viral infection or\\nan inflammatory disease. Electrophysiological tests, in\\nwhich a muscle or nerve is artificially stimulated, may be\\nused to assess the condition of facial muscles and the\\nfacial nerve. Common tests include electromyography,\\nwhich measures voluntary muscle movement, and nerve\\nconduction velocity, which determines the extent of\\nnerve degeneration. Radiological tests may also be\\nincluded, such as an x ray, as well as imaging tests, such\\nas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed\\ntomography. These tests—especially MRI—allow an\\nexcellent view of the nerve itself.\\nOnce all other possibilities are exhausted, a diagno-\\nsis of Bell’s palsy is made. The following weeks are a\\nperiod of watchful waiting. Further examinations are\\ndone to track recovery. Results from nerve conduction\\ntests may be used to predict an outcome. However, this\\nuse is questioned by some doctors and medical\\nresearchers since evidence for their predictive value is\\ninconclusive.\\nIf facial movement, even a small amount, has not\\nreturned within 3-4 months, the diagnosis of Bell’s palsy\\nmay need to be reevaluated.\\nTreatment\\nMany doctors prescribe an antiviral and/or a steroid\\nfor Bell’s palsy, but there is some controversy about\\nwhether these drugs actually help.

For these people,\\nbenzodiazepines can help bring their feelings under con-\\ntrol. The medicine can also relieve troubling symptoms\\nof anxiety, such as pounding heartbeat, breathing prob-\\nlems, irritability, nausea, and faintness.\\nPhysicians may sometimes prescribe these drugs for\\nother conditions, such as muscle spasms, epilepsy and\\nother seizure disorders,phobias, panic disorder , with-\\ndrawal from alcohol, and sleeping problems. However,\\nthis medicine should not be used every day for sleep\\nproblems that last more than a few days. If used this way,\\nthe drug loses its effectiveness within a few weeks.\\nBenzodiazepines should not be used to relieve the\\nnervousness and tension of normal everyday life.\\nDescription\\nThe family of antianxiety drugs known as benzodi-\\nazepines includes alprazolam (Xanax), chlordiazepoxide\\n(Librium), diazepam (Valium), and lorazepam (Ativan).\\nThese medicines take effect fairly quickly, starting to work\\nwithin an hour after they are taken. Benzodiazepines are\\navailable only with a physician’s prescription and are\\navailable in tablet, capsule, liquid, or injectable forms.\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe recommended dosage depends on the type of\\nbenzodiazepine, its strength, and the condition for which\\nit is being taken. Doses may be different for different\\npeople. Check with the physician who prescribed the\\ndrug or the pharmacist who filled the prescription for the\\ncorrect dosage.\\nAlways take benzodiazepines exactly as directed.\\nNever take larger or more frequent doses, and do not take\\nthe drug for longer than directed. If the medicine does not\\nseem to be working, check with the physician who pre-\\nscribed it. Do not increase the dose or stop taking the\\nmedicine unless the physician says to do so. Stopping the\\ndrug suddenly may cause withdrawal symptoms, espe-\\ncially if it has been taken in large doses or over a long\\nperiod. People who are taking the medicine for seizure\\ndisorders may have seizures if they stop taking it sudden-\\nly. If it is necessary to stop taking the medicine, check\\nwith a physician for directions on how to stop. The physi-\\ncian may recommend tapering down gradually to reduce\\nthe chance of withdrawal symptoms or other problems.\\nPrecautions\\nSeeing a physician regularly while taking benzodi-\\nazepines is important, especially during the first few\\nmonths of treatment. The physician will check to make\\nsure the medicine is working as it should and will note\\nunwanted side effects.\\nPeople who take benzodiazepines to relieve nervous-\\nness, tension, or symptoms of panic disorder should\\ncheck with their physicians every two to three months to\\nmake sure they still need to keep taking the medicine.\\nPatients who are taking benzodiazepines for sleep\\nproblems should check with their physicians if they are\\nnot sleeping better within 7-10 days. Sleep problems that\\nlast longer than this may be a sign of another medical\\nproblem.\\nPeople who take this medicine to help them sleep\\nmay have trouble sleeping when they stop taking the\\nmedicine. This effect should last only a few nights.\\nSome people, especially older people, feel drowsy,\\ndizzy, lightheaded, or less alert when using benzodi-\\nazepines. The drugs may also cause clumsiness or\\nunsteadiness. When the medicine is taken at bedtime,\\nthese effects may even occur the next morning.

Beriberi literally means “I can’t, I can’t” in Sing-\\nhalese, which reflects the crippling effect it has on its\\nvictims. It is common in parts of southeast Asia, where\\nwhite rice is the main food. In the United States, beriberi\\nis primarily seen in people with chronic alcoholism.\\nDescription\\nBeriberi puzzled medical experts for years as it rav-\\naged people of all ages in Asia. Doctors thought it was\\ncaused by something in food. Not until the early 1900s\\ndid scientists discover that rice bran, the outer covering\\nthat was removed to create the polished white rice pre-\\nferred by Asians, actually contained something that pre-\\nvented the disease. Thiamine was the first vitamin identi-\\nfied. In the 1920s, extracts of rice polishings were used\\nto treat the disease.\\nIn adults, there are different forms of beriberi, classi-\\nfied according to the body systems most affected. Dry\\nberiberi involves the nervous system; wet beriberi affects\\nthe heart and circulation. Both types usually occur in the\\nsame patient, with one set of symptoms predominating.\\nA less common form of cardiovascular, or wet\\nberiberi, is known as “shoshin.” This condition involves a\\nrapid appearance of symptoms and acute heart failure. It\\nis highly fatal and is known to cause sudden death in\\nyoung migrant laborers in Asia whose diet consists of\\nwhite rice.\\nCerebral beriberi, also known as Wernicke-Korsakoff\\nsyndrome, usually occurs in chronic alcoholics and affects\\nthe central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). It can\\nbe caused by a situation that aggravates a chronic thiamine\\ndeficiency, like an alcoholic binge or severe vomiting.\\nInfantile beriberi is seen in breastfed infants of thi-\\namine-deficient mothers, who live in developing nations.\\nAlthough severe beriberi is uncommon in the United\\nStates, less severe thiamine deficiencies do occur. About\\n25% of all alcoholics admitted to a hospital in the United\\nStates show some evidence of thiamine deficiency.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThiamine is one of the B vitamins and plays an\\nimportant role in energy metabolism and tissue building.\\nIt combines with phosphate to form the coenzyme thi-\\namine pyrophosphate (TPP), which is essential in reac-\\ntions that produce energy from glucose or that convert\\nglucose to fat for storage in the tissues. When there is not\\nenough thiamine in the diet, these basic energy functions\\nare disturbed, leading to problems throughout the body.\\nSpecial situations, such as an over-active metabo-\\nlism, prolonged fever, pregnancy , and breastfeeding,\\ncan increase the body’s thiamine requirements and lead\\nto symptoms of deficiency. Extended periods of diar-\\nrhea or chronic liver disease can result in the body’s\\ninability to maintain normal levels of many nutrients,\\nincluding thiamine. Other persons at risk are patients\\nwith kidney failure on dialysis and those with severe\\ndigestive problems who are unable to absorb nutrients.\\nAlcoholics are susceptible because they may substitute\\nalcohol for food and their frequent intake of alcohol\\ndecreases the body’s ability to absorb thiamine.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 469\\nBeriberi\\nGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 469'),\n",

When the cells of the smooth\\nmuscles in the digestive system and glands do not get\\nenough energy from glucose, they are unable to pro-\\nduce more glucose from the normal digestion of food.\\nThere is a loss of appetite,indigestion , severe consti-\\npation, and a lack of hydrochloric acid in the stomach.\\n• Nervous System. Glucose is essential for the central\\nnervous system to function normally. Early deficiency\\nsymptoms are fatigue, irritability, and poor memory. If\\nthe deficiency continues, there is damage to the periph-\\neral nerves that causes loss of sensation and muscle\\nweakness, which is called peripheral neuropathy. The\\nlegs are most affected. The toes feel numb and the feet\\nhave a burning sensation; the leg muscles become sore\\nand the calf muscles cramp. The individual walks\\nunsteadily and has difficulty getting up from a squatting\\nposition. Eventually, the muscles shrink (atrophy) and\\nthere is a loss of reflexes in the knees and feet; the feet\\nmay hang limp (footdrop).\\n• Cardiovascular system. There is a rapid heartbeat and\\nsweating. Eventually the heart muscle weakens.\\nBecause the smooth muscle in the blood vessels is\\naffected, the arteries and veins relax, causing swelling,\\nknown as edema, in the legs.\\n• Musculoskeletal system. There is widespread muscle\\npain caused by the lack of TPP in the muscle tissue.\\nInfants who are breastfed by a thiamine-deficient mother\\nusually develop symptoms of deficiency between the\\nsecond and fourth month of life. They are pale, restless,\\nunable to sleep, prone to diarrhea, and have muscle\\nwasting and edema in their arms and legs. They have a\\ncharacteristic, sometimes silent, cry and develop heart\\nfailure and nerve damage.\\nDiagnosis\\nA physical examination will reveal many of the\\nearly symptoms of beriberi, such as fatigue, irritation,\\nnausea, constipation, and poor memory, but the deficien-\\ncy may be difficult to identify. Information about the\\nindividual’s diet and general health is also needed.\\nThere are many biochemical tests based on thiamine\\nmetabolism or the functions of TPP that can detect a thi-\\namine deficiency. Levels of thiamine can be measured in\\nthe blood and urine and will be reduced if there is a defi-\\nciency. The urine can be collected for 24 hours to mea-\\nsure the level of thiamine excreted. Another reliable test\\nmeasures the effect of TPP on red blood cell activity\\nsince all forms of beriberi affect the metabolism of red\\nblood cells.\\nAn electroencephalogram (EEG), which measures\\nelectrical activity in the brain, may be done to rule out\\nother causes of neurologic changes. Observing improve-\\nments in the patient after giving thiamine supplements\\nwill also confirm the diagnosis.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment with thiamine reverses the deficiency in\\nthe body and relieves most of the symptoms. Severe thi-\\namine deficiency is treated with high doses of thiamine\\ngiven by injection into a muscle (intramuscular) or in a\\nsolution that goes into a vein (intravenously) for several\\ndays. Then smaller doses can be given either by injection\\nor in pill form until the patient recovers. Usually there\\nare other deficiencies in the B vitamins that will also\\nneed treatment.\\nThe cardiovascular symptoms of wet beriberi can\\nrespond to treatment within a few hours if they are not\\ntoo severe. Heart failure may require additional treatment\\nwith diuretics that help eliminate excess fluid and with\\nheart-strengthening drugs like digitalis.\\nRecovery from peripheral neuropathy and other\\nsymptoms of dry beriberi may take longer and patients\\nfrequently become discouraged. They should stay active;\\nphysical therapy will also help in recovery.\\nInfantile beriberi is treated by giving thiamine to\\nboth the infant and the breast feeding mother until levels\\nare normal.\\nIn Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, thiamine should\\nbe given intravenously or by injection at first because the\\nintestinal absorption of thiamine is probably impaired\\nand the patient is very ill. Most of the symptoms will be\\nrelieved by treatment, though there may be residual\\nmemory loss.\\nExcess thiamine is excreted by the body in the urine,\\nand negative reactions to too much thiamine are rare.\\nThiamine is unstable in alkali solutions, so it should not\\nbe taken with antacids or barbiturates.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative treatments for beriberi deal first with\\ncorrecting the thiamine deficiency. As in conventional\\ntreatments, alternative treatments for beriberi stress a\\ndiet rich in foods that provide thiamine and other B vita-\\nmins, such as brown rice, whole grains, raw fruits and\\nvegetables, legumes, seeds, nuts, and yogurt. Drinking\\nmore than one glass of liquid with a meal should be\\navoided, since this may wash out the vitamins before\\nthey can be absorbed by the body.

Berylliosis occurs in both acute and chronic\\nforms. In some cases, appearance of the disease may be\\ndelayed as much as 20 years after exposure to beryllium.\\nDescription\\nIn the 1930s, scientists discovered that beryllium\\ncould make fluorescent light bulbs last longer. During the\\nfollowing decade, the hard, grayish metal was identified\\nas the cause of a potentially debilitating, sometimes\\ndeadly disease characterized by shortness of breath and\\ninflammation, swelling, and scarring of the lungs.\\nThe manufacture of fluorescent light bulbs is no\\nlonger a source of beryllium exposure, but serious health\\nhazards are associated with any work environment or\\nprocess in which beryllium fumes or particles become\\nairborne. Working with pure beryllium, beryllium com-\\npounds (e.g. beryllium oxide), or beryllium alloys causes\\noccupational exposure. So do jobs involving:\\n• electronics\\n• fiber optics\\n• manufacturing ceramics, bicycle frames, golf clubs,\\nmirrors, and microwave ovens\\n• mining\\n• nuclear weapons and reactors\\n• reclaiming scrap metal\\n• space and atomic engineering.\\n• dental and laboratory technology\\nBeryllium dust and fumes are classified as toxic air\\npollutants by the Environmental Protection Agency\\n(EPA). It is estimated that 2–6% of workers exposed to\\nthese contaminants eventually develop berylliosis.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCoughing, shortness of breath, and weight loss that\\nbegin abruptly can be a symptom of acute berylliosis. This\\ncondition is caused by beryllium air pollution that inflames\\nthe lungs making them rigid; it can affect the eyes and skin\\nas well. People who have acute berylliosis are usually very\\nill. Most recover, but some die of the disease.\\nChronic berylliosis is an allergic reaction to long-\\nterm exposure to even low levels of beryllium dust or\\nfumes. A systemic disease that causes formation of\\nabnormal lung tissue and enlargement of the lymph\\nnodes, chronic berylliosis also may affect other parts of\\nthe body. The symptoms of chronic berylliosis are large-\\nly the same as those seen in acute berylliosis, but they\\ndevelop more slowly.\\nDiagnosis\\nBerylliosis is initially suspected if a patient with symp-\\ntoms of the disease has a history of beryllium exposure. A\\nchest x rayshows characteristic changes in the lungs.\\nHowever, since these changes can resemble those caused\\nby other lung diseases, further testing may be necessary.\\nThe beryllium lymphocyte proliferation test (BeLPT),\\na blood test that can detect beryllium sensitivity (i.e. an\\nallergic reaction to beryllium), is used to screen individuals\\nat risk of developing berylliosis. When screening results\\nreveal a high level of sensitivity, BeLPT is performed on\\ncells washed from the lungs. This test is now considered\\nthe most definitive diagnostic test for berylliosis.\\nTreatment\\nIndividuals with beryllium sensitivity or early-stage\\nberylliosis should be transferred from tasks that involve\\nberyllium exposure and regularly examined to determine\\nwhether the disease has progressed.\\nAcute berylliosis is a serious disease that occasion-\\nally may be fatal. Ventilators can help patients with acute\\nberylliosis breathe. Prompt corticosteroid therapy is\\nrequired to lessen lung inflammation.\\nChronic beryllium disease is incurable. Corticos-\\nteroid therapy is often prescribed, but it is not certain that\\nsteroids can alter the progression of the disease, and they\\nhave no effect on scarring of lung tissue. Cleansing the\\nlungs of beryllium is a slow process, so long-term thera-\\npy may be required. Chelation therapy is currently\\nunder investigation as a treatment for the disease.\\nPrognosis\\nMost patients with acute berylliosis recover fully\\n7–10 days after treatment begins, and the disease usually\\ncauses no after effects.\\nPatients whose lungs are severely damaged by\\nchronic berylliosis may experience fatal heart failure\\nbecause of the strain placed on the heart.\\nPrevention\\nEliminating exposure to beryllium is the surest way\\nto prevent berylliosis. Screening workers who are\\nexposed to beryllium fumes or dust or who develop an\\nallergic reaction to these substances is an effective way\\nto control symptoms and prevent disease progression.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2472\\nBerylliosis\\nGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 472'),\n",

Increased production or destruction of\\nthese cells causes Beta2-microglobulin levels in the blood\\nto increase. This increase is seen in people with cancers\\ninvolving white blood cells, but it is particularly mean-\\ningful in people newly diagnosed with multiple myelo-\\nma. Multiple myeloma is a malignancy (cancer) of a cer-\\ntain kind of white blood cell, called a plasma cell. At the\\ntime of diagnosis, the Beta2-microglobulin levels reflect\\nhow advanced the disease is and the likely prognosis for\\nthat person.\\nWhen kidney disease is suspected, comparing blood\\nand urine levels helps identify where the kidney is dam-\\naged. Beta2-microglobulin normally is filtered out of the\\nblood by the kidney’s glomeruli (a round mass of capil-\\nlary loops leading to each kidney tubule), only to be par-\\ntially reabsorbed back into the blood when it reaches the\\nkidney’s tubules. In glomerular kidney disease, the\\nglomeruli can’t filter it out of the blood, so levels\\nincrease in the blood and decrease in the urine. In tubular\\nkidney disease, the tubules can’t reabsorb it back into the\\nblood, so urine levels rise and blood levels fall. After a\\nkidney transplant, increased blood levels may be an early\\nsign of rejection.\\nIncreased urinary levels are found in people with\\nkidney damage caused by high exposure to the heavy\\nmetals cadmium and mercury. Periodic testing of work-\\ners exposed to these metals helps to detect beginning kid-\\nney damage.\\nBeta2-microglobulin levels also rise during infec-\\ntion with some viruses, including cytomegalovirus and\\nhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Studies show\\nthat as HIV disease advances, beta 2-microglobulin lev-\\nels rise.\\nDescription\\nTesting methods vary, but most involve adding the\\nperson’s serum—the yellow, liquid part of blood—or\\nurine to one or more substances that bind to beta2-\\nmicroglobulin in the serum or urine. The amount of the\\nsubstance(s) bound to beta2-microglobulin is measured\\nand the original amount of beta 2-microglobulin is\\ndetermined.\\nThe test is covered by insurance when medically\\nnecessary.

This, in turn, decreases\\nthe force and rate of the heart’s contractions, which lowers\\nblood pressure and reduces the heart’s demand for oxygen.\\nPurpose\\nThe main use of beta blockers is to treat high blood\\npressure. Some also are used to relieve the type of chest\\npaincalled angina or to prevent heart attacks in people\\nwho already have had one heart attack . These drugs\\nmay also be prescribed for other conditions, such as\\nmigraine,tremors, and irregular heartbeat. In eye drop\\nform, they are used to treat certain kinds of glaucoma.\\nDescription\\nBeta blockers, also known as beta-adrenergic block-\\ners, are available only with a physician’s prescription.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2474\\nBeta blockers\\nGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 474'),\n",

It is a rare tumor with poor outcome for most patients.\\nDescription\\nBile is a substance manufactured by the liver that\\naids in the digestion of food. Bile ducts are channels that\\ncarry the bile from the liver to the small intestine. Like\\nthe tributaries of a river, the small bile ducts in the liver\\nconverge into two large bile ducts called the left and right\\nhepatic ducts. These exit the liver and join to form the\\ncommon hepatic duct. The gallbladder, which concen-\\ntrates and stores the bile, empties into the common\\nhepatic duct to form the common bile duct. Finally, this\\nlarge duct connects to the small intestine where the bile\\ncan help digest food. Collectively, this network of bile\\nducts is called the biliary tract.\\nBile duct cancer originates from the cells that line\\nthe inner surface of the bile ducts. A tumor may arise\\nanywhere along the biliary tract, either within or outside\\nof the liver. Bile duct tumors are typically slow-growing\\ntumors that spread by local invasion of neighboring\\nstructures and by way of lymphatic channels.\\nBile duct cancer is an uncommon malignancy. In the\\nUnited States, approximately one case arises per 100,000\\npeople per year, but it is more common in Southeast\\nAsia. It occurs in men only slightly more often than in\\nwomen, and it is most commonly diagnosed in people in\\ntheir 50s and 60s.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nA number of risk factors are associated with the\\ndevelopment of bile duct cancer:\\n• Primary sclerosing cholangitis. This disease is charac-\\nterized by extensive scarring of the biliary tract, some-\\ntimes associated with inflammatory bowel disease.\\n• Choledochal cysts. These are abnormal dilatations of\\nthe biliary tract that usually form during fetal develop-\\nment. There is evidence that these cysts may rarely\\narise during adulthood.\\n• Hepatolithiasis. This is the condition of stone formation\\nwithin the liver (not including gallbladder stones).\\n• Liver flukes. Parasitic infection with certain worms is\\nthought to be at least partially responsible for the higher\\nprevalence of bile duct cancer in Southeast Asia.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 477\\nBile duct cancer\\nGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 477'),\n",

Bilirubin, a component of bile, builds up within\\nthe liver and is absorbed into the bloodstream in excess\\namounts. This can be detected in a blood test, but it can\\nalso manifest as yellowish discoloring of the skin and\\neyes. The bilirubin in the bloodstream also makes the\\nurine appear dark. Additionally, the patient may experi-\\nence generalized itching due to the deposition of bile\\ncomponents in the skin. Normally, a portion of the bile is\\nexcreted in stool; bile actually gives stool its brown\\ncolor.

Sometimes the biliary tract can become\\ninfected, but this is normally a rare consequence of inva-\\nsive tests. Infection causes fever, chills, and pain in the\\nright upper portion of the abdomen.\\nDiagnosis\\nCertain laboratory tests of the blood may aid in the\\ndiagnosis. The most important one is the test for elevated\\nbilirubin levels in the bloodstream. Levels of alkaline\\nphosphatase and CA 19-9 may also be elevated.\\nWhen symptoms, physical signs, and blood tests\\npoinmt toward an abnormality of the biliary tract, then\\nthe next step involves radiographic tests. Ultrasound and\\ncomputed tomography (CT scan) are noninvasive and\\nrapid. These tests can often detect the actual tumor as\\nwell as dilatation of the obstructed biliary tract. If these\\ntests indicate the presence of a tumor, then cholangiogra-\\nphy is required. This procedure involves injecting dye\\ninto the biliary tract to obtain anatomic images of the bile\\nducts and the tumor. The specialist that performs this test\\ncan also insert small tubes, or stents, into a partially\\nobstructed portion of the bile duct to prevent further\\nobstruction by growth of the tumor. This is vitally impor-\\ntant since it may be the only intervention that is possible\\nin certain patients. Cholangiography is an invasive test\\nthat carries a small risk of infection of the biliary tract.\\nThe objective of these radiological tests is to determine\\nthe size and location of the tumor, as well as the extent of\\nspread to nearby structures.\\nThe treatment of bile duct tumors is usually not\\naffected by the specific type of cancer cells that comprise\\nthe tumor. For this reason, some physicians forego biop-\\nsy of the tumor.\\nTreatment\\nThe treatment is with surgical resection (removal) of\\nthe tumor and all involved structures. Unfortunately,\\nsometimes the cancer has already spread too far when the\\ndiagnosis is made. Thus, in the treatment of bile duct can-\\ncer, the first question to answer is if the tumor may be\\nsafely resected by surgery with reasonable benefit to the\\npatient. If the cancer involves certain blood vessels or has\\nspread widely throughout the liver, then resection may not\\nbe possible. Sometimes further invasive testing is required.\\nAngiography can determine if the blood vessels are\\ninvolved. Laparoscopy is a surgical procedure that allows\\nthe surgeon to directly assess the tumor and nearby lymph\\nnodes without making a large incision in the abdomen. Only\\nabout 45% of bile duct cancers are ultimately resectable.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2478\\nBile duct cancer\\nGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 478'),\n",

Half of all liver transplants are done for this reason.\\nThe normal anatomy of the bile system begins with-\\nin the liver, where thousands of tiny bile ducts collect\\nbile from liver cells. These ducts merge into larger and\\nlarger channels, like streams flowing into rivers, until\\nthey all pour into a single duct that empties into the duo-\\ndenum (first part of the small intestine). Between the\\nliver and the duodenum this duct has a side channel con-\\nnected to the gall bladder. The gall bladder stores bile\\nand concentrates it, removing much of its water content.\\nThen, when a meal hits the stomach, the gall bladder\\ncontracts and empties its contents.\\nBile is a mixture of waste chemicals that the liver\\nremoves from the circulation and excretes through the\\nbiliary system into the intestine. On its way out, bile\\nassists in the digestion of certain nutrients. If bile cannot\\nget out because the channels are absent or blocked, it\\nbacks up into the liver and eventually into the rest of the\\nbody. The major pigment in bile is a chemical called\\nbilirubin, which is yellow. Bilirubin is a breakdown prod-\\nuct of hemoglobin (the red chemical in blood that carries\\noxygen).

An immediate evaluation\\nthat includes blood tests and imaging of the biliary sys-\\ntem will confirm the diagnosis.\\nTreatment\\nSurgery is the only treatment. Somehow the surgeon\\nmust create an adequate pathway for bile to escape the\\nliver into the intestine. The altered anatomy of the biliary\\nsystem is different in every case, calling upon the sur-\\ngeon’s skill and experience to select and execute the most\\neffective among several options. If the obstruction is only\\nbetween the gall bladder and the intestine, it is possible to\\nattach a piece of intestine directly to the gall bladder. More\\nlikely, the upper biliary system will also be inadequate,\\nand the surgeon will attach a piece of intestine directly to\\nthe liver—the Kasai procedure. In its wisdom, the body\\nwill discover that the tiny bile ducts in that part of the liver\\nare discharging their bile directly into the intestine. Bile\\nwill begin to flow in that direction, and the channels will\\ngradually enlarge. Survival rates for the Kasai procedure\\nare commonly 50% at five years and 15% at 10 years.

The binge eater\\nconsumes unnaturally large amounts of food in a short\\ntime period, but unlike a bulimic, does not regularly\\nengage in any inappropriate weight-reducing behaviors\\n(for example, excessive exercise, vomiting, taking laxa-\\ntives) following the binge episodes.\\nDescription\\nBED typically strikes individuals sometime between\\nadolescence and the early twenties. Because of the nature\\nof the disorder, most BED patients are overweight or\\nobese. Studies of weight loss programs have shown that\\nan average of 30% of individuals enrolling in these pro-\\ngrams report binge eating behavior.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nBinge eating episodes may act as a psychological\\nrelease for excessive emotional stress. Other circum-\\nstances that may predispose an individual to BED include\\nheredity and affective disorders, such as major depression.\\nBED patients are also more likely to have a comorbid, or\\nco-existing, diagnosis of impulsive behaviors (for exam-\\nple, compulsive buying),post-traumatic stress disorder\\n(PTSD), panic disorder, or personality disorders.\\nIndividuals who develop BED often come from fam-\\nilies who put an unnatural emphasis on the importance of\\nfood, for example, as a source of comfort in times of\\nemotional distress. As children, BED patients may have\\nbeen taught to clean their plate regardless of their\\nappetite, or that finishing a meal made them a “good”\\ngirl or boy. Cultural attitudes towards beauty and thin-\\nness may also be a factor in the BED equation.\\nDuring binge episodes, BED patients experience a\\ndefinite sense of lost control over their eating. They eat\\nquickly and to the point of discomfort even if they aren’t\\nhungry. They typically binge alone two or more times a\\nweek, and often feel depressed and guilty once the\\nepisode has concluded.\\nDiagnosis\\nBinge eating disorder is usually diagnosed and treated\\nby a psychiatrist and/or a psychologist. In addition to an\\ninterview with the patient, personality and behavioral\\ninventories, such as the Minnesota Multiphasic Person-\\nality Inventory (MMPI), may be administered as part of\\nthe assessment process. One of several clinical inventories,\\nor scales, may also be used to assess depressive symptoms,\\nincluding the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D) or\\nBeck Depression Inventory (BDI). These tests may be\\nadministered in an outpatient or hospital setting.\\nTreatment\\nMany BED individuals binge after long intervals of\\nexcessive dietary restraint; therapy helps normalize this\\npattern. The initial goal of BED treatment is to teach the\\npatient to gain control over his eating behavior by focus-\\ning on eating regular meals and avoiding snacking. Cog-\\nnitive-behavioral therapy, group therapy, or interper-\\nsonal psychotherapy may be employed to uncover the\\nemotional motives, distorted thinking, and behavioral\\npatterns behind the binge eating.\\nBecause the prevalence of depression in BED\\npatients is high, psychopharmacological treatment with\\nantidepressants may also be prescribed. Once the binge\\neating behavior is curbed and depressive symptoms are\\ncontrolled, the physical symptoms of BED can be\\naddressed. The overweight BED patient may be placed\\non a moderate exercise program and a nutritionist may be\\nconsulted to educate the patient on healthy food choices\\nand strategies for weight loss.\\nPrognosis\\nThe poor dietary habits and obesity that are sympto-\\nmatic of BED can lead to serious health problems, such as\\nhigh blood pressure, heart attacks, and diabetes, if left\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 481\\nBinge-eating disorder\\nGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 481'),\n",

The name biofeedback refers to the bio-\\nlogical signals that are fed back, or returned, to the patient\\nin order for the patient to develop techniques of manipu-\\nlating them.\\nPurpose\\nBiofeedback has been used to successfully treat a\\nnumber of disorders and their symptoms, including tem-\\nporomandibular joint disorder (TMJ), chronic pain,\\nirritable bowel syndrome (IBS), Raynaud’s syndrome,\\nepilepsy, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder\\n(ADHD), migraine headaches, anxiety, depression, trau-\\nmatic brain injury, and sleep disorders.\\nIllnesses that may be triggered at least in part by\\nstress are also targeted by biofeedback therapy. Certain\\ntypes of headaches, high blood pressure, bruxism (teeth\\ngrinding), post-traumatic stress disorder, eating disor-\\nders, substance abuse, and some anxiety disorders may\\nbe treated successfully by teaching patients the ability to\\nrelax and release both muscle and mental tension.\\nBiofeedback is often just one part of a comprehensive\\ntreatment program for some of these disorders.\\nNASA has used biofeedback techniques to treat\\nastronauts who suffer from severe space sickness, during\\nwhich the autonomic nervous system is disrupted. Scien-\\ntists at the University of Tennessee have adapted these\\ntechniques to treat individuals suffering from severe\\nnausea and vomitingthat is also rooted in autonomic\\nnervous system dysfunction.\\nRecent research also indicates that biofeedback may\\nbe a useful tool in helping patients with urinary inconti-\\nnence regain bladder control. Individuals learning pelvic-\\nfloor muscle strengthening exercises can gain better con-\\ntrol over these muscles by using biofeedback. Sensors are\\nplaced on the muscles to train the patient where they are\\nand when proper contractions are taking place.\\nDescription\\nOrigins\\nIn 1961, Neal Miller, an experimental psychologist,\\nsuggested that autonomic nervous system responses (for\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2482\\nBiofeedback\\nGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 482'),\n",

As a result of his experiments, he showed that\\nsuch autonomic processes were controllable. This work\\nled to the creation of biofeedback therapy. Willer’s work\\nwas expanded by other researchers. Thereafter, research\\nperformed in the 1970s by UCLA researcher Dr. Barry\\nSterman established that both cats and monkeys could be\\ntrained to control their brain wave patterns. Sterman then\\nused his research techniques on human patients with\\nepilepsy, where he was able to reduce seizures by 60%\\nwith the use of biofeedback techniques. Throughout the\\n1970s, other researchers published reports of their use of\\nbiofeedback in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias ,\\nheadaches, Raynaud’s syndrome, and excess stomach\\nacid, and as a tool for teaching deep relaxation. Since the\\nearly work of Miller and Sterman, biofeedback has\\ndeveloped into a front-line behavioral treatment for an\\neven wider range of disorders and symptoms.\\nDuring biofeedback, special sensors are placed on\\nthe body. These sensors measure the bodily function that\\nis causing the patient problem symptoms, such as heart\\nrate, blood pressure, muscle tension (EMG or elec-\\ntromyographic feedback), brain waves (EEC or elec-\\ntroencophalographic feedback), respiration, and body\\ntemperature (thermal feedback), and translates the infor-\\nmation into a visual and/or audible readout, such as a\\npaper tracing, a light display, or a series of beeps.\\nWhile the patient views the instantaneous feedback\\nfrom the biofeedback monitors, he or she begins to recog-\\nnize what thoughts, fears, and mental images influence his\\nor her physical reactions. By monitoring this relationship\\nbetween mind and body, the patient can then use these\\nsame thoughts and mental images as subtle cues, as these\\nact as reminders to become deeply relaxed, instead of anx-\\nious. These reminders also work to manipulate heart beat,\\nbrain wave patterns, body temperature, and other bodily\\nfunctions. This is achieved through relaxation exercises,\\nmental imagery, and other cognitive therapy techniques.\\nAs the biofeedback response takes place, patients\\ncan actually see or hear the results of their efforts instant-\\nly through the sensor readout on the biofeedback equip-\\nment. Once these techniques are learned and the patient\\nis able to recognize the state of relaxation or visualiza-\\ntion necessary to alleviate symptoms, the biofeedback\\nequipment itself is no longer needed. The patient then\\nhas a powerful, portable, and self-administered treatment\\ntool to deal with problem symptoms.\\nBiofeedback that specializes in reading and altering\\nbrain waves is sometimes called neurofeedback . The\\nbrain produces four distinct types of brain waves—delta,\\ntheta, alpha, and beta—that all operate at a different fre-\\nquency. Delta, the slowest frequency wave, is the brain\\nwave pattern associated with sleep. Beta waves, which\\noccur in a normal, waking state, can range from 12-35\\nHz. Problems begin to develop when beta wave averages\\nfall in the low end (underarousal) or the high end (over-\\narousal) of that spectrum. Underarousal might be present\\nin conditions such as depression or attention-deficit dis-\\norder, and overarousal may be indicative of an anxiety\\ndisorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, or excessive\\nstress. Beta wave neurofeedback focuses on normalizing\\nthat beta wave pattern to an optimum value of around 14\\nHz. A second type of neurofeedback, alpha-theta, focus-\\nes on developing the more relaxing alpha (8-13 Hz) and\\ntheta waves (4-9 Hz) that are usually associated with\\ndeep, meditative states, and has been used with some\\nsuccess in substance abuse treatment.\\nThrough brain wave manipulation, neurofeedback\\ncan be useful in treating a variety of disorders that are\\nsuspected or proven to impact brain wave patterns, such\\nas epilepsy, attention-deficit disorder, migraine\\nheadaches, anxiety, depression, traumatic brain injury,\\nand sleep disorders. The equipment used for neurofeed-\\nback usually uses a monitor as an output device. The\\nmonitor displays specific patterns that the patient\\nattempts to change by producing the appropriate type of\\nbrain wave. Or, the monitor may reward the patient for\\nproducing the appropriate brain wave by producing a\\npositive reinforcer, or reward. For example, children may\\nbe rewarded with a series of successful moves in a dis-\\nplayed video game.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 483\\nBiofeedback\\nA patient undergoing biofeedback therapy.(Photo\\nResearchers, Inc.

The average age of onset of bipolar disor-\\nder is from adolescence through the early twenties.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 499}, page_content='Bipolar I disorder is characterized by manic\\nepisodes, the “high” of the manic-depressive cycle. A\\nbipolar patient experiencing mania often has feelings of\\nself-importance, elation, talkativeness, increased socia-\\nbility, and a desire to embark on goal-oriented activities,\\ncoupled with the characteristics of irritability, impa-\\ntience, impulsiveness, hyperactivity, and a decreased\\nneed for sleep. Usually this manic period is followed by\\na period of depression, although a few bipolar I individu-\\nals may not experience a major depressive episode.\\nMixed states, where both manic or hypomanic symptoms\\nand depressive symptoms occur at the same time, also\\noccur frequently with bipolar I patients (for example,\\ndepression with the racing thoughts of mania). Also, dys-\\nphoric mania is common (mania characterized by anger\\nand irritability).\\nBipolar II disorder is characterized by major depres-\\nsive episodes alternating with episodes of hypomania, a\\nmilder form of mania. Bipolar depression may be diffi-\\ncult to distinguish from a unipolar major depressive\\nepisode. Patients with bipolar depression tend to have\\nextremely low energy, retarded mental and physical\\nprocesses, and more profound fatigue (for example,\\nhypersomnia; a sleep disorder marked by a need for\\nexcessive sleep or sleepiness when awake) than unipolar\\ndepressives.\\nCyclothymia refers to the cycling of hypomanic\\nepisodes with depression that does not reach major depres-\\nsive proportions. A third of patients with cyclothymia will\\ndevelop bipolar I or II disorder later in life.\\nA phenomenon known as rapid cycling occurs in up\\nto 20% of bipolar I and II patients. In rapid cycling,\\nmanic and depressive episodes must alternate frequently;\\nat least 4 times in 12 months; to meet the diagnostic defi-\\nnition. In some cases of “ultra-rapid cycling,” the patient\\nmay bounce between manic and depressive states several\\ntimes within a 24-hour period. This condition is very\\nhard to distinguish from mixed states.\\nBipolar NOS is a category for bipolar states that do\\nnot clearly fit into the bipolar I, II, or cyclothymia diag-\\nnoses.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe source of bipolar disorder has not been clearly\\ndefined. Because two-thirds of bipolar patients have a\\nfamily history of affective or emotional disorders,\\nresearchers have searched for a genetic link to the disor-\\nder. Several studies have uncovered a number of possible\\ngenetic connections to the predisposition for bipolar dis-\\norder. Another possible biological cause under investiga-\\ntion is the presence of an excessive calcium build-up in\\nthe cells of bipolar patients. Also, dopamine and other\\nneurochemical transmitters appear to be implicated in\\nbipolar disorder and these are under intense investigation.\\nOver half of patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder\\nhave a history of substance abuse. There is a high rate of\\nassociation between cocaine abuse and bipolar disorder.\\nSome studies have shown up to 30% of abusers meeting\\nthe criteria for bipolar disorder. The emotional and physi-\\ncal highs and lows of cocaine use correspond to the\\nmanic depression of the bipolar patient, making the dis-\\norder difficult to diagnosis.\\nFor some bipolar patients, manic and depressive\\nepisodes coincide with seasonal changes. Depressive\\nepisodes are typical during winter and fall, and manic\\nepisodes are more probable in the spring and summer\\nmonths.\\nSymptoms of bipolar depressive episodes include\\nlow energy levels, feelings of despair, difficulty concen-\\ntrating, extreme fatigue, and psychomotor retardation\\n(slowed mental and physical capabilities). Manic\\nepisodes are characterized by feelings of euphoria, lack\\nof inhibitions, racing thoughts, diminished need for\\nsleep, talkativeness, risk taking, and irritability. In\\nextreme cases, mania can induce hallucinations and\\nother psychotic symptoms such as grandiose illusions.\\nDiagnosis\\nBipolar disorder is usually diagnosed and treated by\\na psychiatrist and/or a psychologist with medical assis-\\ntance. In addition to an interview, several clinical inven-\\ntories or scales may be used to assess the patient’s mental\\nstatus and determine the presence of bipolar symptoms.\\nThese include the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory\\nIII (MCMI-III),Minnesota Multiphasic Personality\\nInventory II (MMPI-2), the Internal State Scale (ISS),\\nthe Self-Report Manic Inventory (SRMI), and the Young\\nMania Rating Scale (YMRS). The tests are verbal and/or\\nwritten and are administered in both hospital and outpa-\\ntient settings.\\nPsychologists and psychiatrists typically use the cri-\\nteria listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of\\nMental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) as a guide-\\nline for diagnosis of bipolar disorder and other mental\\nillnesses. DSM-IV describes a manic episode as an\\nabnormally elevated or irritable mood lasting a period of\\nat least one week that is distinguished by at least three of\\nthe mania symptoms: inflated self-esteem, decreased\\nneed for sleep, talkativeness, racing thoughts, dis-\\ntractibility, increase in goal-directed activity, or exces-\\nsive involvement in pleasurable activities that have a\\nhigh potential for painful consequences.

DSM-IV notes that unlike manic episodes, hypoman-\\nic episodes do not cause a marked impairment in social\\nor occupational functioning, do not require hospitaliza-\\ntion, and do not have psychotic features. In addition,\\nbecause hypomanic episodes are characterized by high\\nenergy and goal directed activities and often result in a\\npositive outcome, or are perceived in a positive manner\\nby the patient, bipolar II disorder can go undiagnosed.\\nBipolar symptoms often present differently in chil-\\ndren and adolescents. Manic episodes in these age groups\\nare typically characterized by more psychotic features\\nthan in adults, which may lead to a misdiagnosis of schiz-\\nophrenia. Children and adolescents also tend toward irri-\\ntability and aggressiveness instead of elation. Further,\\nsymptoms tend to be chronic, or ongoing, rather than\\nacute, or episodic. Bipolar children are easily distracted,\\nimpulsive, and hyperactive, which can lead to a misdiag-\\nnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\\nFurthermore, their aggression often leads to violence,\\nwhich may be misdiagnosed as a conduct disorder.\\nSubstance abuse, thyroid disease, and use of pre-\\nscription or over-the-counter medication can mask or\\nmimic the presence of bipolar disorder. In cases of sub-\\nstance abuse, the patient must ordinarily undergo a peri-\\nod of detoxification and abstinence before a mood disor-\\nder is diagnosed and treatment begins.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of bipolar disorder is usually by means of\\nmedication. A combination of mood stabilizing agents\\nwith antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants\\nis used to regulate manic and depressive episodes.\\nMood stabilizing agents such as lithium, carba-\\nmazepine, and valproate are prescribed to regulate the\\nmanic highs and lows of bipolar disorder:\\n• Lithium (Cibalith-S, Eskalith, Lithane, Lithobid,\\nLithonate, Lithotabs) is one of the oldest and most fre-\\nquently prescribed drugs available for the treatment of\\nbipolar mania and depression. Because the drug takes\\nfour to ten days to reach a therapeutic level in the blood-\\nstream, it is sometimes prescribed in conjunction with\\nneuroleptics and/or benzodiazepines to provide more\\nimmediate relief of a manic episode. Lithium has also\\nbeen shown to be effective in regulating bipolar depres-\\nsion, but is not recommended for mixed mania. Lithium\\nmay not be an effective long-term treatment option for\\nrapid cyclers, who typically develop a tolerance for it, or\\nmay not respond to it. Possible side effects of the drug\\ninclude weight gain, thirst, nausea, and hand tremors.\\nProlonged lithium use may also cause hyperthyroidism\\n(a disease of the thryoid that is marked by heart palpita-\\ntions, nervousness, the presence of goiter, sweating,\\nand a wide array of other symptoms.)\\n• Carbamazepine (Tegretol, Atretol) is an anticonvulsant\\ndrug usually prescribed in conjunction with other mood\\nstabilizing agents. The drug is often used to treat bipo-\\nlar patients who have not responded well to lithium\\ntherapy. Blurred vision and abnormal eye movement\\nare two possible side effects of carbamazepine therapy.\\nAs of early 1998, carbamazepine did not have an FDA-\\ncleared indication for mania.\\n• Valproate (divalproex sodium, or Depakote; valproic\\nacid, or Depakene) is one of the few drugs available that\\nhas been proven effective in treating rapid cycling bipo-\\nlar and mixed states patients. Valproate is prescribed\\nalone or in combination with carbamazepine and/or lithi-\\num. Stomach cramps,indigestion, diarrhea, hair loss,\\nappetite loss, nausea, and unusual weight loss or gain are\\nsome of the common side effects of valproate. Note: val-\\nproate is also approved for the treatment of mania.\\nBecause antidepressants may stimulate manic\\nepisodes in some bipolar patients, their use is typically\\nshort-term. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors\\n(SSRIs) or, less often, monoamine oxidase inhibitors\\n(MAO inhibitors) are prescribed for episodes of bipolar\\ndepression. Tricyclic antidepressants used to treat unipo-\\nlar depression may trigger rapid cycling in bipolar\\npatients and are, therefore, not a preferred treatment\\noption for bipolar depression.\\n• SSRIs, such as fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft),\\nand paroxetine (Paxil), regulate depression by regulating\\nlevels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter. Anxiety, diarrhea,\\ndrowsiness, headache, sweating, nausea, sexual prob-\\nlems, and insomniaare all possible side effects of SSRIs.\\n• MAOIs such as tranylcypromine (Parnate) and phenel-\\nzine (Nardil) block the action of monoamine oxidase\\n(MAO), an enzyme in the central nervous system.\\nPatients taking MAOIs must cut foods high in tyramine\\n(found in aged cheeses and meats) out of their diet to\\navoid hypotensive side effects.\\n• Bupropion (Wellbutrin) is a heterocyclic antidepres-\\nsant.

In bipolar patients, ECT is\\noften used in conjunction with drug therapy.\\nAdjunct treatments are used in conjunction with a\\nlong-term pharmaceutical treatment plan:\\n• Long-acting benzodiazepines such as clonazepam (Klon-\\napin) and alprazolam (Xanax) are used for rapid treat-\\nment of manic symptoms to calm and sedate patients until\\nmania or hypomania have waned and mood stabilizing\\nagents can take effect. Sedation is a common effect, and\\nclumsiness, lightheadedness, and slurred speech are other\\npossible side effects of benzodiazepines.\\n• Neuroleptics such as chlorpromazine (Thorazine) and\\nhaloperidol (Haldol) are also used to control mania\\nwhile a mood stabilizer such as lithium or valproate\\ntakes effect. Because neuroleptic side effects can be\\nsevere (difficulty in speaking or swallowing,paralysis\\nof the eyes, loss of balance control, muscle spasms,\\nsevere restlessness, stiffness of arms and legs, tremors\\nin fingers and hands, twisting movements of body, and\\nweakness of arms and legs), benzodiazepines are gener-\\nally preferred over neuroleptics.\\n• Psychotherapy and counseling. Because bipolar disorder\\nis thought to be biological in nature, therapy is recom-\\nmended as a companion to, but not a substitute for, phar-\\nmaceutical treatment of the disease. Psychotherapy, such\\nas cognitive-behavioral therapy, can be a useful tool in\\nhelping patients and their families adjust to the disorder,\\nin encouraging compliance to a medication regimen, and\\nin reducing the risk of suicide. Also, educative counsel-\\ning is recommended for the patient and family.\\nCalcium channel blockers (nimodipine, or Nimo-\\ntop), typically used to treat angina and hypotension,h a v e\\nbeen found effective, in a few small studies, for treating\\nrapid cyclers. Calcium channel blockers stop the excess\\ncalcium build up in cells that is thought to be a cause of\\nbipolar disorder. They are usually used in conjunction with\\nother drug therapies such as carbamazepine or lithium.\\nClozapine (Clozaril) is an atypical antipsychotic\\nmedication used to control manic episodes in patients\\nwho have not responded to typical mood stabilizing\\nagents. The drug has also been a useful prophylactic, or\\npreventative treatment, in some bipolar patients. Common\\nside effects of clozapine include tachycardia (rapid heart\\nrate), hypotension,constipation, and weight gain. Agran-\\nulocytosis, a potentially serious but reversible condition\\nin which the white blood cells that typically fight infec-\\ntion in the body are destroyed, is a possible side effect of\\nclozapine. Patients treated with the drug should undergo\\nweekly blood tests to monitor white blood cell counts.\\nRisperidone (Risperdal) is an atypical antipsychotic\\nmedication that has been successful in controlling mania\\nin several clinical trials when low doses were adminis-\\ntered. The side effects of risperidone are mild compared\\nto many other antipsychotics (constipation, coughing,\\ndiarrhea, dry mouth, headache,heartburn , increased\\nlength of sleep and dream activity, nausea, runny nose,\\nsore throat, fatigue, and weight gain).\\nLamotrigine (Lamictal, or LTG), an anticonvulsant\\nmedication, was found to alleviate manic symptoms in a\\n1997 trial of 75 bipolar patients. The drug was used in\\nconjunction with divalproex (divalproate) and/or lithium.\\nPossible side effects of lamotrigine include skin rash,\\ndizziness, drowsiness, headache, nausea and vomiting.\\nrTMS, or repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation\\nis a new and still experimental treatment for the depres-\\nsive phase of bipolar disorder. In rTMS, a large magnet is\\nplaced on the patient’s head and magnetic fields of dif-\\nferent frequency are generated to stimulate the left front\\ncortex of the brain. Unlike ECT, rTMS requires no anes-\\nthesia and does not induce seizures.\\nAlternative treatment\\nGeneral recommendations include maintaining a\\ncalm environment, avoiding over stimulation, getting\\nplenty of rest, regular exercise, and proper diet. Chinese\\nherbs may soften mood swings. Biofeedback is effective\\nin helping some patients control symptoms such as irri-\\ntability, poor self control, racing thoughts, and sleep\\nproblems. A diet low in vanadium (a mineral found in\\nmeats and other foods) and high in vitamin C may be\\nhelpful in reducing depression.\\nPrognosis\\nWhile most patients will show some positive response\\nto treatment, response varies widely, from full recovery to a\\ncomplete lack of response to all drug and/or ECT therapy.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2488\\nBipolar disorder\\nGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 488'),\n",

More than 3,000 have been identified.\\nDescription\\nBirth defects are found in 2-3% of all newborn\\ninfants. This rate doubles in the first year, and reaches\\n10% by age five, as more defects become evident and can\\nbe diagnosed. Almost 20% of deaths in newborns are\\ncaused by birth defects.\\nAbnormalities can occur in any major organ or part\\nof the body. Major defects are structural abnormalities\\nthat affect the way a person looks and require medical\\nand/or surgical treatment. Minor defects are abnormali-\\nties that do not cause serious health or social problems.\\nWhen multiple birth defects occur together and have a\\nsimilar cause, they are called syndromes. If two or more\\ndefects tend to appear together but do not share the same\\ncause, they are called associations.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe specific cause of many congenital abnormalities\\nis unknown, but several factors associated with pregnan-\\ncy and delivery can increase the risk of birth defects.\\nTeratogens\\nAny substance that can cause abnormal develop-\\nment of the egg in the mother’s womb is called a terato-\\ngen. In the first two months after conception, the devel-\\noping organism is called an embryo; developmental\\nstages from two months to birth are called fetal. Growth\\nis rapid, and each body organ has a critical period in\\nwhich it is especially sensitive to outside influences.\\nAbout 7% of all congenital defects are caused by expo-\\nsure to teratogens.\\nDRUGS. Only a few drugs are known to cause birth\\ndefects, but all have the potential to cause harm. Thalido-\\nmide is known to cause defects of the arms and legs; sev-\\neral other types also cause problems.\\n• Alcohol. Drinking large amounts of alcohol while preg-\\nnant causes a cluster of defects called fetal alcohol\\nsyndrome , which include mental retardation , heart\\nproblems, and growth deficiency.\\n• Antibiotics. Certain antibiotics are known tetratogens.\\nTetracycline affects bone growth and discolors the\\nteeth. Drugs used to treat tuberculosis can lead to hear-\\ning problems and damage to a nerve in the head (cra-\\nnial). Sulfa drugs are associated with abnormally high\\nlevels of bilirubin in the newborn, which can cause\\ndeath.\\n• Anticonvulsants. Drugs given to prevent seizures can\\ncause serious problems in the developing fetus, includ-\\ning mental retardation and slow growth.\\n• Antipsychotic and antianxiety agents. Several drugs\\ngiven for anxiety and mental illness are known to cause\\nspecific defects.\\n• Antineoplastic agents. Drugs given to treat cancer can\\ncause major congenital malformations, especially central\\nnervous system defects. They may also be harmful to the\\nhealth care worker who is giving them while pregnant.\\n• Hormones. Male hormones may cause masculinization\\nof a female fetus. A synthetic estrogen (DES) given in\\nthe 1940s and 1950s causes an increased risk of cancer\\nin the adult female children of the mothers who\\nreceived the drug.\\n• Recreational drugs. Drugs such as LSD have been asso-\\nciated with arm and leg abnormalities and central ner-\\nvous system problems in infants. Crack cocaine has\\nalso been associated with birth defects. Since drug\\nabusers tend to use many drugs and have poor nutri-\\ntion and prenatal care, it is hard to determine the effects\\nof individual drugs.\\nCHEMICALS. Environmental chemicals such as\\nfungicides, food additives, and pollutants are suspected\\nof causing birth defects, though this is difficult to prove.\\nRADIATION. Exposure of the mother to high levels of\\nradiation can cause small skull size (microcephaly), blind-\\nness,spina bifida, and cleft palate. How severe the defect\\nis depends on the duration and timing of the exposure.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2490\\nBirth defects\\nGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 490'),\n",

Three viruses are known to harm a\\ndeveloping baby: rubella, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and\\nherpes simplex. Toxoplasma gondii,a parasite that can be\\ncontracted from undercooked meat, from dirt, or from\\nhandling the feces of infected cats, causes serious prob-\\nlems. Untreated syphilis in the mother is also harmful.\\nGenetic factors\\nA gene is a tiny, invisible unit containing informa-\\ntion (DNA) that guides how the body forms and func-\\ntions. Each individual inherits tens of thousands of genes\\nfrom each parent, arranged on 46 chromosomes. Genes\\ncontrol all aspects of the body, how it works, and all its\\nunique characteristics, including eye color and body size.\\nGenes are influenced by chemicals and radiation, but\\nsometimes changes in the genes are unexplained acci-\\ndents. Each child gets half of its genes from each parent.\\nIn each pair of genes one will take precedence (domi-\\nnant) over the other (recessive) in determining each trait,\\nor characteristic. Birth defects caused by dominant inher-\\nitance include a form of dwarfism called achondropla-\\nsia; high cholesterol ; Huntington’s disease, a progres-\\nsive nervous system disorder; Marfan syndrome, which\\naffects connective tissue; some forms of glaucoma, and\\npolydactyly (extra fingers or toes).\\nIf both parents carry the same recessive gene, they\\nhave a one-in-four chance that the child will inherit the\\ndisease. Recessive diseases are severe and may lead to an\\nearly death. They include sickle cell anemia, a blood disor-\\nder that affects blacks, and Tay-Sachs disease , which\\ncauses mental retardation in people of eastern European\\nJewish heritage. Two recessive disorders that affect mostly\\nwhites are:cystic fibrosis, a lung and digestive disorder,\\nand phenylketonuria(PKU), a metabolic disorder. If only\\none parent passes along the genes for the disorder, the nor-\\nmal gene received from the other parent will prevent the\\ndisease, but the child will be a carrier. Having the gene is\\nnot harmful to the carrier, but there is the 25% chance of\\nthe genetic disease showing up in the child of two carriers.\\nSome disorders are linked to the sex-determining\\nchromosomes passed along by parents. Hemophilia ,a\\ncondition that prevents blood from clotting, and\\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy , which causes muscle\\nweakness, are carried on the X chromosome.

This is more common in older mothers.\\nThe most common defect of this kind is Down syn-\\ndrome, a pattern of mental retardation and physical\\nabnormalities, often including heart defects, caused by\\ninheriting three copies of a chromosome rather than the\\nnormal pair.\\nA less understood cause of birth defects results from\\nthe interaction of genes from one or both parents plus\\nenvironmental influences. These defects are thought to\\ninclude:\\n• Cleft lip and palate, which are malformations of the\\nmouth\\n• Clubfoot, ankle or foot deformities.\\n• Spina bifida, an open spine caused when the tube that\\nforms the brain and spinal chord does not close properly.\\n• Water on the brain ( hydrocephalus ), which causes\\nbrain damage.\\n• Diabetes mellitus, an abnormality in sugar metabolism\\nthat appears later in life.\\n• Heart defects.\\n• Some forms of cancer.\\nA serious illness in the mother, such as an underac-\\ntive thyroid, or diabetes mellitus, in which her body can-\\nnot process sugar, can also cause birth defects in the child.\\nAn abnormal amount of amniotic fluid may indicate or\\ncause birth defects. Amniotic fluid is the liquid that sur-\\nrounds and protects the unborn child in the uterus. Too lit-\\ntle of this fluid can interfere with lung or limb develop-\\nment. Too much amniotic fluid can accumulate if the\\nfetus has a disorder that interferes with swallowing.\\nDiagnosis\\nIf there is a family history of birth defects or if the\\nmother is over 35 years old, then screening tests can be\\ndone during pregnancy to gain information about the\\nhealth of the baby.\\n• Alpha-fetoprotein test. This is a simple blood test that\\nmeasure the level of a substance called alpha-fetopro-\\ntein that is associated with some major birth defects. An\\nabnormally high or low level may indicate the need for\\nfurther testing.\\n• Ultrasound. The use of sound waves to examine the\\nshape, function, and age of the fetus is a common proce-\\ndure. It can also detect many malformations, such as\\nspina bifida, limb defects, and heart and kidney problems.\\n• Amniocentesis. This test is usually done between the\\n13th and 15th weeks of pregnancy. A small sample of\\namniotic fluid is withdrawn through a thin needle\\ninserted into the mother’s abdomen. Chromosomal\\nanalysis can rule out Down syndrome and other genetic\\nconditions.\\n• Chorionic villus sampling (CVS). This test can be done\\nas early as the ninth week of pregnancy to identify\\nchromosome disorders and some genetic conditions. A\\nthin needle is inserted through the abdomen or a slim\\ntube is inserted through the vagina that takes a tiny tis-\\nsue sample for testing.\\nIf a birth defect is suspected after a baby is born,\\nthen confirmation of the diagnosis is very important. The\\npatient’s medical records and medical history may hold\\nessential information. A careful physical examination\\nand laboratory tests should be done. Special diagnostic\\ntests can also provide genetic information in some cases.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment depends on the type of birth defect and\\nhow serious it is. When an abnormality has been identi-\\nfied before birth, then delivery can be planned at a health\\ncare facility that is prepared to offer any special care\\nneeded.

Some\\nare symptomless but others bleed if enlarged or injured.\\nDisfiguring port-wine stains can cause emotional and\\nsocial problems. About 5% of port-wine stains on the\\nforehead and eyelids increase eye pressure due to\\ninvolvement of the eye and surrounding nerves.

This approach is particularly appropriate for the\\ntreatment of hemangiomas, which often do not require\\ntreatment, since they eventually shrink by themselves.\\nDrugs\\nCORTICOSTEROIDS. Daily doses of the anti-inflam-\\nmatory drugs prednisone or prednisolone are given for up\\nto 2 months with gradual reduction of the dose. The marks\\nbegin to subside within 7-10 days, but may take up to 2\\nmonths to fully disappear. If no response is seen in 2\\nweeks, the drug is discontinued. Treatment may be repeat-\\ned. Side effects include growth retardation, increased blood\\npressure and blood sugar,cataracts, glandular disorders,\\nand infection. The corticosteroids triamcinolone acetate\\nand betamethasone sodium phosphate or acetate are inject-\\ned directly into the marks with a response usually achieved\\nwithin a week; additional injections are given in 4-6 weeks.\\nSide effects include tissue damage at the injection site.\\nINTERFERON ALPHA-2A. This drug reduces cell\\ngrowth, and is used for vascular marks that affect vision,\\nand that are unresponsive to corticosteroids. Given in daily\\ninjections under the skin, a response rate of 50% is\\nachieved after about 7 months. Side effects include fever,\\nchills, muscle and joint pain, vision disorders, low white\\nand red blood cell counts,fatigue, elevated liver enzymes,\\nnausea, blood clotting problems, and nerve damage.\\nANTIBIOTICS. Oral or topical (applied to the skin)\\nantibiotics are prescribed for infected marks.\\nSurgery\\nLASER SURGERY. Lasers create intense heat that\\ndestroys abnormal blood vessels beneath the skin, with-\\nout damaging normal skin. Two types of lasers are used:\\nthe flashlamp-pulsed dye laser (FPDL) and the neodymi-\\num:Y AG (Nd:Y AG) laser. The FPDL, used mainly for\\nstrawberry marks and port-wine stains, penetrates to a\\ndepth of 1.8 mm and causes little scarring, while the\\nNd:Y AG laser penetrates to a depth of 6 mm, and is used\\nto treat deep hemangiomas. Laser surgery is not usually\\npainful, but can be uncomfortable. Anesthetic cream is\\nused for FPDL treatment. Treatment with the Nd:Y AG\\nlaser requires local or general anesthesia. Children are\\nusually sedated or anesthetized. Healing occurs within 2\\nweeks. Side effects include bruising, skin discoloration,\\nswelling, crusting, and minor bleeding.\\nSURGICAL EXCISION. Under local or general anes-\\nthesia, the skin is cut with a surgical instrument, and vas-\\ncular marks or their scars are removed. The cut is\\nrepaired with stitches or skin clips.\\nCRYOSURGERY. Vascular marks are frozen with an\\nextremely cold substance sprayed onto the skin. Wounds\\nheal with minimal scarring.\\nELECTRODESICCATION. Affected vessels are des-\\ntroyed with the current from an electric needle.\\nOther treatments\\nThese include:\\n• Sclerotherapy. Injection of a special solution causes\\nblood clotting and shrinkage with little scarring. Side\\neffects include stinging, swelling, bruising, scarring,\\nmuscle cramping, and allergic reactions. This treatment\\nis used most commonly for spider angiomas.\\n• Embolization.

In the United States, where the dog popula-\\ntion exceeds 50 million, dogs surpass all other mammals\\nin the number of bites inflicted on humans. However,\\nmost dog-bite injuries are minor. A telephone survey of\\nU.S. households conducted in 1994 led researchers to\\nestimate that 3,737,000 dog bites not requiring medical\\nattention occurred in the United States that year, versus\\n757,000 that did require medical treatment. Studies also\\nshow that most dog bites are from pets or other dogs\\nknown to the bitten person, that males are more likely\\nthan females to be bitten, and that children face a greater\\nrisk than adults. Each year, about 10-20 Americans,\\nmostly children under 10 years of age, are killed by dogs.\\nDog bites result in an estimated 340,000 emergency-\\nroom visits annually throughout the United States. More\\nthan half of the bites seen by emergency departments\\noccur at home. Children under 10 years old, especially\\nboys between 5 and 9 years of age, are more likely than\\nolder people to visit an emergency room for bite treat-\\nment. Children under 10 years old were also much more\\nliable to be bitten on the face, neck, and head. Nearly all\\nof the injuries suffered by people seeking treatment in\\nemergency rooms were of “low severity,” and most were\\ntreated and released without being admitted to hospital or\\nsent to another facility. Many of the bites resulted from\\npeople attempting to break up fights between animals.\\nCATS. Although cats are found in nearly a third of\\nU.S. households, cat bites are far less common than dog\\nbites. According to one study, cats inflict perhaps\\n400,000 harmful bites in the United States each year. The\\ntissue damage caused by cat bites is usually limited, but\\nthey carry a high risk of infection. Whereas the infection\\nrate for dog bite injuries is 15-20%, the infection rate for\\ncat bites is 30-40%. A typical person who has been bitten\\nis a young girl playing with a pet.\\nHUMANS. Bites from mammals other than dogs and\\ncats are uncommon, with one exception—human bites.\\nThere are approximately 70,000 human bites each year\\nin the United States. Because the human mouth contains\\na multitude of potentially harmful microorganisms,\\nhuman bites are more infectious than those of most other\\nanimals.\\nArthropods\\nArthropods are invertebrates belonging to the phy-\\nlum Arthropoda, which includes insects, arachnids, crus-\\ntaceans, and other subgroups. There are more than\\n700,000 species in all. The list of arthropods that bite or\\nsting humans is extensive and includes lice, bedbugs,\\nfleas, mosquitoes, black flies, ants, chiggers, ticks, cen-\\ntipedes, scorpions, and other species. Spiders, bees, and\\nwasps are the three kinds of arthropod that most often\\nbite people.\\nSPIDERS. In the United States, only two kinds of ven-\\nomous spider are truly dangerous: widow spiders and\\nbrown (violin or fiddle) spiders. The black widow, which\\nis found in every state but Alaska, is probably the most\\nnotorious widow spider. It prefers dark, dry places such as\\nbarns, garages, and outhouses, and also lives under rocks\\nand logs. Disturbing a female black widow or its web\\nmay provoke a bite. Brown spiders also prefer sheltered\\nplaces, including clothing, and may bite if disturbed.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 497\\nBites and stings\\nGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 497'),\n",

Species com-\\nmon to the United States include honeybees, bumble-\\nbees, yellow jackets, bald-faced hornets, brown hornets,\\nand paper wasps. Of note are also Africanized bee\\nspecies, also called “killer bees” that are now found in\\nthe United States since 1990. More than fifty Americans\\ndie each year after being stung by a bee, wasp, or ant.\\nAlmost all of those deaths are the result of allergic reac-\\ntions, and not of exposure to the venom itself.\\nSnakes\\nThere are 20 species of venomous snakes in the\\nUnited States. These snakes are found in every state\\nexcept Maine, Alaska, and Hawaii. Each year about\\n8,000 Americans receive a venomous snakebite, but no\\nmore than about 15 die, mostly from rattlesnake bites.\\nThe venomous snakes of the United States are divid-\\ned into two families, the Crotalidae (pit vipers) and the\\nElapidae. Pit vipers, named after the small heat-sensing\\npit that lies between each eye and nostril, are responsible\\nfor about 99% of the venomous snakebites suffered by\\nAmericans. Rattlesnakes, copperheads, and cottonmouths\\n(also called water moccasins) are pit vipers. This family\\nof snakes delivers its venom through two long, hinged\\nfangs in the upper jaw. Some pit vipers carry a potent\\nvenom that can threaten the brain and spinal cord. The\\nvenom of others, such as the copperheads, is less harmful.\\nThe Elapidae family includes two kinds of ven-\\nomous coral snakes indigenous to the southern and west-\\nern states. Because coral snakes are bashful creatures\\nthat come out only at night, they almost never bite\\nhumans, and are responsible for approximately 25 bites a\\nyear in the United States. Coral snakes also have short\\nfangs and a small mouth, which lowers the risk of a bite\\nactually forcing venom into a person’s body. However,\\ntheir venom is quite poisonous.\\nMarine animals\\nSeveral varieties of marine animal may bite or sting.\\nJellyfish and stingrays are two kinds that pose a threat to\\npeople who live or vacation in coastal communities.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nMammals\\nDOGS. A typical dog bite results in a laceration, tear,\\npuncture, or crush injury. Bites from large, powerful dogs\\nmay even cause fractures and dangerous internal\\ninjuries. Also, dogs trained to attack may bite repeatedly\\nduring a single episode. Infected bites usually cause pain,\\ncellulitis (inflammation of the connective tissues), and a\\npus-filled discharge at the wound site within 8-24 hours.\\nMost infections are confined to the wound site, but many\\nof the microorganisms in the mouths of dogs can cause\\nsystemic and possibly life-threatening infections. Exam-\\nples are bacteremia and meningitis, especially severe in\\npeople diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syn-\\ndrome ( AIDS) or other health condition that increases\\ntheir susceptibility to infection. Rabies is rare among pet\\ndogs in the United States, most of which have been vacci-\\nnated against the disease. Tetanus is also rare but can be\\ntransmitted by a dog bite if the victim is not immunized.\\nCATS. The mouths of cats and dogs contain many of\\nthe same microorganisms. Cat scratches and bites are\\nalso capable of transmitting the Bartonella henselae bac-\\nterium, which can lead to cat-scratch disease ,a n\\nunpleasant but usually not life-threatening illness.\\nCat bites are mostly found on the arms and hands.\\nSharp cat teeth typically leave behind a deep puncture\\nwound that can reach muscles, tendons, and bones, which\\nare vulnerable to infection because of their comparatively\\npoor blood supply. This is why cat bites are much more\\nlikely to become infected than dog bites. Also, people are\\nless inclined to view cat bites as dangerous requiring\\nimmediate attention; the risk that infection has set in by\\nthe time a medical professional is consulted is thus greater.\\nHUMANS. Humans bites result from fights, sexual\\nactivity, medical and dental treatment, and seizures. Bites\\nalso raise the possibility of spousal or child abuse. Chil-\\ndren often bite other children, but those bites are hardly\\never severe. Human bites are capable of transmitting a\\nwide range of dangerous diseases, including hepatitis B,\\nsyphilis, and tuberculosis.\\nHuman bites fall into two categories: occlusional\\n(true) bites and clenched-fist injuries. The former present\\na lower risk of infection. The latter, which are very infec-\\ntious and can permanently damage the hand, usually\\nresult from a fist hitting teeth during a fight. People often\\nwait before seeking treatment for a clenched-fist injury,\\nwith the result that about half of such injuries are infect-\\ned by the time they are seen by a medical professional.\\nArthropods\\nSPIDERS. As a rule, people rarely see a black widow\\nbite, nor do they feel the bite as it occurs. The first (and\\npossibly only) evidence that a person has been bitten may\\nbe a mild swelling of the injured area and two red punc-\\nture marks. Within a short time, however, some victims\\nbegin to experience severe muscle cramps and rigidity of\\nthe abdominal muscles. Other possible symptoms include\\nexcessive sweating, nausea, vomiting, headaches, and\\nvertigo as well as breathing, vision, and speech problems.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2498\\nBites and stings\\nGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 498'),\n",

The bite may also be accompanied\\nby a fever, chills, edema (an accumulation of excess tis-\\nsue fluid), nausea and vomiting, dizziness, muscle and\\njoint pain, and a rash.\\nBEES AND WASPS. The familiar symptoms of bee\\nand wasp stings include pain, redness, swelling, and itch-\\niness in the area of the sting. Multiple stings can have\\nmuch more severe consequences, such as anaphylaxis,a\\nlife-threatening allergic reaction that occurs in hypersen-\\nsitive persons.\\nSnakes\\nVenomous pit viper bites usually begin to swell\\nwithin 10 minutes and sometimes are painful. Other\\nsymptoms include skin blisters and discoloration, weak-\\nness, sweating, nausea, faintness, dizziness, bruising, and\\ntender lymph nodes. Severe poisoning can also lead to\\ntingling in the scalp, fingers, and toes, muscle contrac-\\ntions, an elevated heart rate, rapid breathing, large drops\\nin body temperature and blood pressure, vomiting of\\nblood, and coma.\\nMany pit viper and coral snake bites (20-60%) fail to\\npoison (envenomate) their victim, or introduce only a\\nsmall amount of venom into the victim’s body. The\\nwounds, however, can still become infected by the harm-\\nful microorganisms that snakes carry in their mouths.\\nCoral snake bites are painful but may be hard to see.\\nOne to seven hours after the bite, a bitten person begins to\\nexperience the effects of the venom, which include tingling\\nat the wound site, weakness, nausea, vomiting, excessive\\nsalivation, and irrational behavior. Major nerves of the\\nbody can become paralyzed for 6-14 days, causing double\\nvision, difficulty swallowing and speaking,respiratory\\nfailure, and other problems. Six to eight weeks may be\\nneeded before normal muscular strength is regained.\\nMarine animals\\nJELLYFISH. Jellyfish venom is delivered by barbs\\ncalled nematocysts, which are located on the creature’s\\ntentacles and penetrate the skin of people who brush up\\nagainst them. Instantly painful and itchy red lesions usu-\\nally result. The pain can continue up to 48 hours. Severe\\ncases may lead to skin necrosis,muscle spasms and\\ncramps, vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, headaches, exces-\\nsive sweating, and other symptoms. In rare instances,\\ncardiorespiratory failure may also occur.\\nSTINGRAYS. Tail spines are the delivery mechanism\\nfor stingray venom. Deep puncture wounds result that can\\ncause an infection if pieces of spine become embedded in\\nthe wound. A typical stingray injury scenario involves a\\nperson who inadvertently steps on a resting stingray and is\\nlashed in the ankle by its tail. Stingray venom produces\\nimmediate, excruciating pain that lasts several hours.\\nSometimes the victim suffers a severe reaction, including\\nvomiting, diarrhea, hemorrhage (bleeding), a drop in blood\\npressure, and cardiac arrhythmia (disordered heart beat).\\nDiagnosis\\nMammals\\nDOGS. Gathering information on the circumstances\\nof a dog attack is a crucial part of treatment. Medical\\nprofessionals need to know when the attack occurred (the\\nchances of infection increase dramatically if the wound\\nhas been left untreated for more than eight hours) and\\nwhat led to the attack (unprovoked attacks are more like-\\nly to be associated with rabies). A person’s general health\\nmust also be assessed, including the tetanus immuniza-\\ntion history if any, as well as information concerning\\npossible allergies to medication and pre-existing health\\nproblems that may increase the risk of infection.\\nA physical examination requires careful scrutiny of\\nthe wound, with special attention to possible bone, joint,\\nligament, muscle, tendon, nerve, or blood-vessel damage\\ncaused by deep punctures or severe crush injuries. Seri-\\nous hand injuries should be evaluated by a specialized\\nsurgeon. Most of the time, laboratory tests for identifying\\nthe microorganisms in bite wounds are performed if\\ninfection is present.

Testing the blood of a person who has\\nbeen bitten for immunity to hepatitis B and other dis-\\neases is always necessary after a human bite. Ideally, the\\nbiter should be tested as well for the presence of trans-\\nmissible disease. Clenched-fist injuries often require\\nevaluation by a hand surgeon or orthopedist. Because\\nmany people will deny having been in a fight, medical\\nprofessionals usually consider lacerations over the fourth\\nand fifth knuckles—the typical result of a clenched-fist\\ninjury—to be evidence of a bite wound. Medical profes-\\nsionals also look for indications of spousal or child\\nabusewhen evaluating human bites.\\nArthropods\\nSPIDERS. Because bites from widow spiders and\\nbrown spiders require different treatments, capturing and\\nidentifying the spider helps to establish diagnosis.\\nSnakes\\nDiagnosis relies on a physical examination of the\\nvictim, information about the circumstances of the bite,\\nand a look at the snake itself (if it can safely be killed and\\nbrought in for identification). Blood tests and urinalysis\\nsupply important data on the victim’s condition. Chest x-\\nrays and electrocardiography (a procedure for measur-\\ning heart activity) may also be necessary.\\nTreatment\\nMammals\\nDOGS. Minor dog bites can be treated at home. The\\nAmerican Academy of Family Physicians recommends\\ngently washing the wound with soap and water and then\\napplying pressure to the injured area with a clean towel\\nto stop the bleeding. The next step is to apply antibiotic\\nointment and a sterile bandage to the wound. To reduce\\nswelling and fend off infection, ice should be applied and\\nthe injured area kept elevated above the level of the heart.\\nThe wound should be cleaned and covered with ointment\\ntwice a day until it heals.\\nAny dog bite that does not stop bleeding after 15\\nminutes of pressure must be seen by a medical profes-\\nsional. The same is true for bites that are deep or gaping;\\nfor bites to the head, hands, or feet; and for bites that\\nmay have broken a bone, damaged nerves, or caused a\\nmajor injury of another kind. Bite victims must also\\nwatch for infection. A fever is one sign of infection, as\\nare redness, swelling, warmth, increased tenderness, and\\npus at the wound site. Diabetics, people with AIDS or\\ncancer, individuals who have not had a tetanus shot in\\nfive years, and anyone else who has a medical problem\\nthat can increase susceptibility to infection should seek\\nmedical treatment no matter how minor the bite appears.\\nMedical treatment of dog bites involves washing the\\nwound with an anti-infective solution. Removal of dead\\nand damaged tissue (under local, regional, or general\\nanesthetic) may be required after the wound has been\\nwashed, and any person whose tetanus shots are not up to\\ndate should receive a booster injection. Some wounds are\\nleft open and allowed to heal on their own, while others\\nrequire stitches (stitching may be delayed a few days if\\ninfection is a concern). Many emergency departments\\nprescribe antibiotics for all people with dog bites, but\\nsome researchers suggest that antibiotics are usually\\nunnecessary and should be limited to those whose\\ninjuries or other health problems make them likely candi-\\ndates for infection. A follow-up visit after one or two\\ndays is generally required for anyone who has received\\nbite treatment.\\nCATS. Because of the high risk of infection, people\\nwho are bitten by a cat should always see a doctor. Cat\\nscratches do not require professional medical treatment\\nunless the wound appears infected or the scratched per-\\nson has a weakened immune system.\\nMedical treatment for cat bites generally follows the\\nprocedures used for dog bites.

No spider bite should be ignored. The anti-\\ndote for severe widow spider bites is a substance called\\nantivenin, which contains antibodies taken from the\\nblood serum of horses injected with spider venom. Doc-\\ntors exercise caution in using antivenin, however,\\nbecause it can trigger anaphylactic shock, a potentially\\ndeadly (though treatable) allergic reaction, and serum\\nsickness, an inflammatory response that can give rise to\\njoint pain, a fever, rashes, and other unpleasant, though\\nrarely serious, consequences.\\nAn antivenin for brown spider bites exists as well,\\nbut it is not yet available in the United States. The drug\\ndapsone, used to treat leprosy, can sometimes stop the\\ntissue death associated with a brown spider bite. Necrot-\\nic areas may need debridement (removal of dead and\\ndamaged tissue) and skin grafts. Pain medications, anti-\\nhistamines, antibiotics, and tetanus shots are a few of the\\nother treatments that are sometimes necessary after a bite\\nfrom a brown spider or widow spider.\\nBEES AND WASPS. Most stings can be treated at\\nhome. A stinger that is stuck in the skin can be scraped\\noff with a blade, fingernail, credit card, or piece of paper\\n(using tweezers may push more venom out of the venom\\nsac and into the wound). The area should be cleaned and\\ncovered with an ice pack. Aspirin and other pain med-\\nications, oral antihistamines, and calamine lotion are\\ngood for treating minor symptoms. Putting meat tender-\\nizer on the wound has no effect.\\nPersons who have been stung and experience an\\nallergic reaction, or who are at risk due to their medical\\nhistory, require immediate medical attention. The danger\\nsigns, which usually begin 10 minutes after an individual\\nis stung (though possibly not for several hours), include\\nnausea, faintness, chest pain, abdominal cramps, diar-\\nrhea, and difficulty swallowing or breathing.\\nSnakes\\nAlthough most snakes are not venomous, any\\nsnakebite should immediately be examined at a hospital.\\nWhile waiting for emergency help to arrive, the victim\\nshould wash the wound site with soap and water, and\\nthen keep the injured area still and at a level lower than\\nthe heart. Ice should never be used on the wound site nor\\nshould attempts be made to suck out the venom. Making\\na cut at the wound site is also dangerous.

Fleming Fallon, Jr., MD, PhD\\nBlack death see Plague\\nBlack lung disease\\nDefinition\\nBlack lung disease is the common name for coal\\nworkers’ pneumoconiosis (CWP) or anthracosis, a\\nlung disease of older workers in the coal industry,\\ncaused by inhalation, over many years, of small\\namounts of coal dust.\\nDescription\\nThe risk of having black lung disease is directly\\nrelated to the amount of dust inhaled over the years; the\\ndisease typically affects workers over age 50. Its com-\\nmon name comes from the fact that the inhalation of\\nheavy deposits of coal dust makes miners lungs look\\nblack instead of a healthy pink. Although people who\\nlive in cities often have some black deposits in their\\nlungs from polluted air, coal miners have much more\\nextensive deposits.\\nIn the years since the federal government has regu-\\nlated dust levels in coal mines, the number of cases of\\nblack lung disease has fallen sharply. Since the Federal\\nCoal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, average dust\\nlevels have fallen from 8.0 mg. per cubic meter to the\\ncurrent standard of 2.0 mg. per cubic meter. The 1969\\nlaw also set up a black lung disability benefits program\\nto compensate coal miners who have been disabled by\\non-the-job dust exposure.\\nDespite the technology available to control the\\nhazard, however, miners still run the risk of develop-\\ning this lung disease. The risk is much lower today,\\nhowever; fewer than 10% of coal miners have any x\\nray evidence of coal dust deposits. When there is such\\nevidence, it often shows up as only small black spots\\nless than 0.4 in (1 cm). in diameter, and may have\\nbeen caused by smoking rather than coal dust. This\\ncondition is called “simple CWP” and does not lead to\\nsymptoms or disability.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nSince the particles of fine coal dust, which a miner\\nbreathes when he is in the mines, cannot be destroyed\\nwithin the lungs or removed from them, builds up. Even-\\ntually, this build-up causes thickening and scarring,\\nmaking the lungs less efficient in supplying oxygen to\\nthe blood.\\nThe primary symptom of the disease is shortness of\\nbreath, which gradually gets worse as the disease pro-\\ngresses. In severe cases, the patient may develop cor pul-\\nmonale, an enlargement and strain of the right side of the\\nheart caused by chronic lung disease. This may eventual-\\nly cause right-sided heart failure.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 505\\nBlack lung disease\\nA light micrograph of a human lung containing particles of\\ninspired coal dust (anthracosis).The black masses shown\\nare groups of coal dust particles.(Photograph by Astrid &\\nHanns-Frieder Michler, Photo Researchers, Inc.

This abnormal\\ngrowth results in a mass of cells that form a tumor.\\nDescription\\nBladder cancer is the fifth most common cancer in\\nthe United States. The American Cancer Society (ACS)\\nestimates that in 1998, approximately 55,000 new cases\\nof bladder cancer will be diagnosed, and it will cause at\\nleast 12,500 deaths. The disease is three times more com-\\nmon among men than women, and the incidence is also\\nhigher in caucasians.\\nThe urinary bladder is a hollow muscular organ that\\nstores urine from the kidneys until it is excreted out of\\nthe body. Two tubes called the ureters bring the urine\\nfrom the kidneys to the bladder. The urethra carries the\\nurine from the bladder to the outside of the body.\\nBladder cancer has a very high rate of recurrence.\\nEven after superficial tumors are completely removed,\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2506\\nBladder cancer\\nGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 506'),\n",

Hence, patients need very fre-\\nquent and thorough follow-up care.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAlthough the exact cause of bladder cancer is not\\nknown, smokers are twice as likely as nonsmokers to get\\nthe disease. Hence,smoking is considered the greatest\\nrisk factor for bladder cancer. Workers who are exposed\\nto certain chemicals that are used in the dye industry and\\nin the rubber, leather, textile, and paint industries are\\nbelieved to be at a higher risk for bladder cancer. The dis-\\nease is also three times more common in men than in\\nwomen; caucasians also are at an increased risk. The risk\\nof bladder cancer increases with age. Most cases are\\nfound in people who are 50–70 years old.\\nFrequent urinary infections, kidney and bladder\\nstones, and other conditions that cause long-term irrita-\\ntion to the bladder may increase the risk of getting blad-\\nder cancer. A past history of tumors in the bladder could\\nalso increase one’s risk of getting other tumors.\\nOne of the first warning signals of bladder cancer is\\nblood in the urine. Sometimes, there is enough blood in the\\nurine to change the color of the urine to a yellow-red or a\\ndark red. At other times, the color of the urine appears nor-\\nmal but chemical testing of the urine reveals the presence\\nof blood cells. A change in bladder habits such as painful\\nurination, increased frequency of urination and a feeling of\\nneeding to urinate but not being able to do so are some of\\nthe signs of possible bladder cancer. All of these symptoms\\nmay also be caused by conditions other than cancer, but it\\nis important to see a doctor and have the symptoms evaluat-\\ned. When detected early and treated appropriately, patients\\nhave a very good chance of being cured completely.\\nDiagnosis\\nIf a doctor has any reason to suspect bladder cancer, he\\nmay use several tests to find out if the disease is present. As\\na first step, a complete medical history will be taken to\\ncheck for any risk factors. A thorough physical examina-\\ntion will be conducted to assess all the signs and symp-\\ntoms. Laboratory testing of a urine sample will help to rule\\nout the presence of a bacterial infection. In a urine cytology\\ntest, the urine is examined under a microscope to look for\\nany abnormal or cancerous cells. A catheter (tube) can be\\nadvanced into the bladder through the urethra, and a salt\\nsolution is passed through it to wash the bladder. The solu-\\ntion can then be collected and examined under a micro-\\nscope to check for the presence of any cancerous cells.\\nA test known as the intravenous pyelogram (IVP) is\\nan x-ray examination that is done after a dye is injected\\ninto the blood stream through a vein in the arm. The dye\\ntravels through the blood stream and then reaches the\\nkidneys to be excreted.

Multiple x rays are taken to\\ndetect any abnormality in the lining of these organs.\\nThe physician may use a procedure known as a cys-\\ntoscopy to view the inside of the bladder. A thin hollow\\nlighted tube is introduced into the bladder through the\\nurethra. If any suspicious looking masses are seen, a\\nsmall piece of the tissue can be removed from it using a\\npair of biopsy forceps. The tissue is then examined\\nmicroscopically to verify if cancer is present, and if so, to\\nidentify the type of cancer.\\nIf cancer is detected and there is evidence to indicate\\nthat it has metastasized (spread) to distant sites in the body,\\nimaging tests such as chest x rays,computed tomography\\nscans (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) may\\nbe done to determine which organs are affected. Bladder\\ncancer generally tends to spread to the lungs, liver, and bone.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment for bladder cancer depends on the stage\\nof the tumor. The patient’s medical history, overall health\\nstatus, and personal preferences are also taken into\\naccount when deciding on an appropriate treatment plan.\\nThe three standard modes of treatment that are available\\nfor bladder cancer are surgery,radiation therapy , and\\nchemotherapy . In addition, newer treatment methods\\nsuch as photodynamic therapy and immunotherapy are\\nalso being investigated in clinical trials.\\nSurgery is considered an option only when the disease\\nis in its early stages. If the tumor is localized to a small area\\nand has not spread to the inner layers of the bladder, then\\nthe surgery is done without cutting open the abdomen. A\\ncytoscope is introduced into the bladder through the ure-\\nthra, and the tumor is removed through it. This procedure is\\ncalled a transurethral resection (TUR). Passing a high-ener-\\ngy laser beam through the cytoscope and burning the can-\\ncer may treat any remaining cancer. This procedure is\\nknown as electrofulguration. If the cancer has invaded the\\nwalls of the bladder, surgery will be done through an inci-\\nsion in the abdomen. Cancer that is not very large can be\\nremoved by partial cystectomy, a procedure where a part\\nof the bladder is removed. If the cancer is large or is present\\nin more than one area of the bladder, a radical cystectomy\\nis done. In this operation, besides the entire bladder, the\\nadjoining organs may also be removed. In men, the prostate\\nis removed, while in women, the uterus, ovaries, and fal-\\nlopian tubes are removed.\\nIf the entire urinary bladder is removed, then an alter-\\nnate storage place must be created for the urine to be\\nstored before it is excreted out of the body. To do this, a\\npiece of intestine is converted into a small bag and\\nattached to the ureters. This is then connected to an open-\\ning (stoma) that is made in the abdominal wall. The proce-\\ndure is called a urostomy. In some urostomy procedures,\\nthe urine from the intestinal sac is routed into a bag that is\\nplaced over the stoma in the abdominal wall. The bag is\\nhidden by the clothing and has to be emptied occasionally\\nby the patient. In a different procedure, the urine is collect-\\ned in the intestinal sac, but there is no bag on the outside of\\nthe abdomen. The intestinal sac has to be emptied by the\\npatient, by placing a drainage tube through the stoma.\\nRadiation therapy that uses high-energy rays to kill\\ncancer cells is generally used after surgery to destroy any\\nremaining cancer cells that may not have been removed\\nduring surgery. If the tumor is in a location that makes\\nsurgery difficult, or if it is large, radiation may be used\\nbefore surgery to shrink the tumor. In cases of advanced\\nbladder cancer, radiation therapy is used to ease the\\nsymptoms such as pain, bleeding, or blockage. Radiation\\ncan be delivered by external beam radiation where a\\nsource of radiation that is outside the body focuses the\\nradiation on the area of the tumor. Occasionally, a small\\npellet of radioactive material may be placed directly into\\nthe cancer. This is known as interstitial radiation therapy.\\nChemotherapy uses anticancer drugs to destroy the\\ncancer cells that may have migrated to distant sites. The\\ndrugs are introduced into the bloodstream by injecting them\\ninto a vein in the arm or taking them orally in pill form.\\nGenerally a combination of drugs is more effective than any\\nsingle drug in treating bladder cancer. Chemotherapy may\\nbe given following surgery to kill any remaining cancer\\ncells. It may also be given even when no remaining cancer\\ncells can be seen. This is called adjuvant chemotherapy.\\nAnticancer drugs, including thiotepa, doxorubicin, and mit-\\nomycin, may also be instilled directly into the bladder\\n(intravesicular chemotherapy) to treat superficial tumors.\\nImmunotherapy or biological therapy, uses the\\nbody’s own immune cells to fight the disease. To treat\\nsuperficial bladder cancer, bacille Calmette-Guerin\\n(BCG) may be instilled directly into the bladder. BCG is\\na weakened (attenuated) strain of the tuberculosis bacil-\\nlus that stimulates the body’s immune system to fight the\\ncancer. This therapy has been shown to be effective in\\ncontrolling superficial bladder cancer.\\nPhotodynamic treatment is a novel mode of treat-\\nment that uses special chemicals and light to kill the can-\\ncerous cells. First, a drug is introduced into the bladder\\nthat makes the cancer cells more susceptible to light. Fol-\\nlowing that, a special light is shone on the bladder in an\\nattempt to destroy the cancerous cells.\\nPrognosis\\nWhen detected at the early stages, the prognosis for\\nbladder cancer is excellent.

These types of stones are much less common than\\nkidney stones.\\nDescription\\nBladder stones can form anywhere in the urinary\\ntract before depositing in the bladder. They begin as tiny\\ngranules about the size of a grain of sand, but they can\\ngrow to more than an inch in diameter. These stones can\\nblock the flow of urine causing pain and difficulty with\\nurination. They can also scratch the bladder wall, which\\nmay lead to bleeding or infection.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nWhile the exact causes of the formation of bladder\\nstones are not completely understood, bladder stones\\nusually occur because of urinary tract infection (UTI),\\nobstruction of the urinary tract, enlargement of the\\nprostate gland in men, or the presence of foreign bodies\\nin the urinary tract. Diet and the amount of fluid intake\\nalso appear to be important factors in the development of\\nbladder stones.\\nNinety-five percent of all bladder stones occur in\\nmen, most of who have an enlarged prostate gland or a\\nUTI. These stones are rarely seen in children or in\\nAfrican Americans. People with gout may develop blad-\\nder stones composed almost entirely of uric acid.\\nThe symptoms of bladder stones may become evi-\\ndent when the wall of the bladder is scratched or when\\nthe urinary tract becomes obstructed by the stone. These\\nsymptoms include:\\n• abnormally dark colored urine\\n• blood in the urine\\n• difficulty urinating\\n• frequent urge to urinate\\n• lower abdominal pain\\n• pain or discomfort in the penis\\nSome people with bladder stones also may experi-\\nence an inability to control urination ( urinary inconti-\\nnence).\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of bladder stones is usually made after a\\nphysical examination, which may include a rectal exami-\\nnation to check for enlargement of the prostate gland.\\nUrine tests are then used to determine if there is blood or\\nindications of an UTI in the urine. If bladder stones are sus-\\npected, bladder or pelvic x rays may be ordered. Stones that\\nare large enough to cause problems with urinary function\\nare almost always detectable by x ray.\\nTreatment\\nMany bladder stones can be passed out of the body\\nin the urine. People with small bladder stones will be\\nasked to increase their fluid intakes to at least six to eight\\neight-ounce glasses of water per day to increase urinary\\noutput. If the stones do not pass after two weeks, or if the\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2510\\nBladder stones\\nGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 510'),\n",

These smaller\\nstones may then pass in the urine. Stones that cannot be\\nbroken into pieces by these methods, or that the patient\\ncannot pass, may have to be surgically removed.\\nAlternative treatment\\nTraditional herbal remedies for bladder stones include\\ncelery seed and horsetail. Also, because incomplete blad-\\nder emptying may cause bladder stones, many patients\\nmay benefit from methods and remedies aimed at improv-\\ning overall bladder function. These include Kegel exercis-\\nes, which are used to strengthen the muscles involved in\\nurination; herbal supplements (cornsilk, hydrangea,\\njuniper berries, parsley, and uva ursi) used to increase\\nurine flow and flush out sediment from the bladder; and,\\nthe consumption of cranberry juice and/or fresh, unsweet-\\nened, lemon juice. Cranberry juice helps to control urinary\\ntract infection and contains a chemical that coats the walls\\nof the bladder, making them more resistant to infection.\\nLemon juice helps to flush out the urinary system.\\nPrognosis\\nMost bladder stones can be, and are, passed out of\\nthe body in the urine without any permanent damage to\\nthe bladder or the rest of the urinary tract. However, most\\nbladder stones arise from an underlying medical condi-\\ntion. Therefore, if this medical condition is not corrected\\napproximately half of all patients will experience a recur-\\nrence of bladder stones within five years.\\nPrevention\\nBladder stones may, in some cases, be prevented by\\nthe patient receiving prompt medical treatment for an\\nenlarged prostate gland or UTI.

In its\\nmost severe form, the infection can spread throughout\\nthe body and involve many organ systems (systemic).\\nDescription\\nBlastomycosis is a fungal infection caused by Blas-\\ntomyces dermatitidis . Although primarily an airborne\\ndisease, farmers and gardeners may become infected\\nfrom contact with spores in the soil through cuts and\\nscrapes.

Canine blastomycosis, a common dog disease, is\\ncaused by the same fungus that infects humans. Howev-\\ner, people do not get this disease from their dogs except\\nonly very rarely through dog bites.\\nBlastomycosis is a rare disease infecting only about\\n4 in every 100,000 people. It is at least six times more\\ncommon in men than in women and tends to more often\\ninfect children and individuals in the 30–50 year old age\\ngroup. People who have diabetes mellitus or who are\\ntaking drugs that suppress the immune system (immuno-\\ncompromised) are more likely to develop blastomycosis.\\nAlthough people with AIDS can get blastomycosis\\nbecause of their weakened immune system, blastomyco-\\nsis has not been one of the more common fungal infec-\\ntions associated with AIDS.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nOnce inhaled, the spores of B. dermatitidis can lodge\\nin the lungs and cause a localized inflammation. This is\\nknown as primary pulmonary blastomycosis. The disease\\ndoes not spread from one person to another. In the early\\nstages, symptoms may include a dry cough, fever, heavy\\nsweating, fatigue, and a general feeling of ill health. In\\napproximately 25% of blastomycosis cases, only the\\nlungs are affected. As the disease progresses, small\\nlesions form in the lungs causing the air sacs deep within\\nthe lungs (alveoli) to break down and form small cavities.\\nIn another 35%, the disease involves both the lungs\\nand the skin. Bumps develop on the skin, gradually\\nbecoming small, white, crusted blisters filled with pus.\\nThe blisters break open, creating abscesses that do not\\nheal. Approximately 19% of infected people have skin\\nsores without infection in the lungs.\\nThe remaining approximately 20% of the infected\\npopulation has blastomycosis that has spread or dissemi-\\nnated to other systems of the body. Symptoms may\\ninclude pain and lesions on one or more bones, the male\\ngenitalia, and/or parts of the central nervous system. The\\nliver, spleen, lymph nodes, heart, adrenal glands, and\\ndigestive system may also be infected.\\nDiagnosis\\nA positive diagnosis of blastomycosis is made when\\nthe fungus B. dermatitidis is identified by direct micro-\\nscopic examination of body fluids such as sputum and\\nprostate fluid or in tissue samples (biopsies) from the\\nlung or skin. Another way to diagnose blastomycosis is\\nto culture and isolate the fungus from a sample of spu-\\ntum. Chest x rays are used to assess lung damage, but\\nalone cannot lead to a definitive diagnosis of blastomy-\\ncosis because any damage caused by other diseases, such\\nas by pneumonia or tuberculosis , may appear look on\\nthe x ray. Because its symptoms vary widely, blastomy-\\ncosis is often misdiagnosed.\\nTreatment\\nBlastomycosis must be treated or it will gradually\\nlead to death. Treatment with the fungicidal drug keto-\\nconazole (Nizoral) taken orally is effective in about 75%\\nof patients. Amphotericin B (Fungizone) given intra-\\nvenously is also very effective, but it has more toxic side\\neffects than ketoconazole. Treatment with amphotericin\\nB usually requires hospitalization, and the patient may\\nalso receive other drugs to minimize the its side effects.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative treatment for fungal infections focuses\\non creating an internal environment where the fungus\\ncannot survive. This is accomplished by eating a diet low\\nin dairy products, sugars, including honey and fruit juice,\\nand foods like beer that contain yeast. This is comple-\\nmented by a diet consisting, in large part, of uncooked\\nand unprocessed foods. Supplements of vitamins C, E,\\nA-plus, and B complex may also be useful. Lactobacillus\\nacidophilus and Bifidobacterium will replenish the good\\nbacteria in the intestines. Some antifungal herbs, like\\ngarlic (Allium sativum ), can be consumed in relatively\\nlarge doses and for an extended period of time in order to\\nincrease effectiveness.

Normally, platelets interact\\nwith the walls of blood vessels to cause a blood clot.\\nThere are many factors in the clotting mechanism, and\\nthey are initiated by platelets. The bleeding time test is\\nusually used on patients who have a history of prolonged\\nbleeding after cuts, or who have a family history of bleed-\\ning disorders. Also, the bleeding time test is sometimes\\nperformed as a preoperative test to determine a patient’s\\nlikely bleeding response during and after surgery.

These medications include anticoagu-\\nlants,diuretics , anticancer drugs , sulfonamides , thi-\\nazide, aspirin and aspirin-containing preparations, and\\nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs . The test may\\nalso be affected by anemia (a deficiency in red blood\\ncells).

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 528}, page_content='Description\\nThere are four methods to perform the bleeding\\ntest. The Ivy method is the traditional format for this\\ntest. In the Ivy method, a blood pressure cuff is placed\\non the upper arm and inflated to 40 mM Hg. A lancet or\\nscalpel blade is used to make a stab wound on the\\nunderside of the forearm. An automatic, spring-loaded\\nblade device is most commonly used to make a stan-\\ndard-sized cut. The area stabbed is selected so that no\\nsuperficial or visible veins are cut. These veins, because\\nof their size, may have longer bleeding times, especial-\\nly in people with bleeding defects. The time from when\\nthe stab wound is made until all bleeding has stopped is\\nmeasured and is called the bleeding time. Every 30 sec-\\nonds, filter paper or a paper towel is used to draw off\\nthe blood. The test is finished when bleeding has\\nstopped completely.\\nThe three other methods of performing the bleeding\\ntest are the template, modified template, and Duke\\nmethods. The template and modified template methods\\nare variations of the Ivy method. A blood pressure cuff\\nis used and the skin on the forearm prepared as in the\\nIvy method. A template is placed over the area to be\\nstabbed and two incisions are made in the forearm using\\nthe template as a location guide. The main difference\\nbetween the template and the modified method is the\\nlength of the cut made.\\nFor the Duke method, a nick is made in an ear lobe\\nor a fingertip is pricked to cause bleeding. As in the Ivy\\nmethod, the test is timed from the start of bleeding until\\nbleeding is completely stopped. The disadvantage to the\\nDuke method is that the pressure on the blood veins in\\nthe stab area is not constant and the results achieved are\\nless reliable. The advantage to the Duke method is that\\nno scar remains after the test. The other methods may\\nresult in a tiny, hairline scar where the wound was made.\\nHowever, this is largely a cosmetic concern.\\nPreparation\\nThere is no special preparation required of the\\npatient for this test. The area to be stabbed should be\\nwiped clean with an alcohol pad. The alcohol should be\\nleft on the skin long enough for it to kill bacteria at the\\nwound site. The alcohol must be removed before stab-\\nbing the arm because alcohol will adversely affect the\\ntests results by inhibiting clotting.\\nAftercare\\nIf a prolonged bleeding time is caused by unknown\\nfactors or diseases, further testing is required to identify\\nthe exact cause of the bleeding problem.\\nKEY TERMS\\nHemostasis —The stopping of bleeding or blood\\nflow through a blood vessel or organ.\\nNormal results\\nA normal bleeding time for the Ivy method is less\\nthan five minutes from the time of the stab until all\\nbleeding from the wound stops. Some texts extend the\\nnormal range to eight minutes. Normal values for the\\ntemplate method range up to eight minutes, while for\\nthe modified template methods, up to 10 minutes is\\nconsidered normal. Normal for the Duke method is\\nthree minutes.\\nAbnormal results\\nA bleeding time that is longer than normal is an\\nabnormal result. The test should be stopped if the patient\\nhasn’t stopped bleeding by 20-30 minutes. Bleeding time\\nis longer when the normal function of platelets is\\nimpaired, or there are a lower-than-normal number of\\nplatelets in the blood.\\nA longer-than-normal bleeding time can indicate\\nthat one of several defects in hemostasis is present,\\nincluding severe thrombocytopenia , platelet dysfunc-\\ntion, vascular defects, V on Willebrand’s disease, or other\\nabnormalities.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nHenry, J.

It is charac-\\nterized by scarring of the liver, which leads to an\\nincrease in the blood pressure in the portal veins.\\nEndoscopy—Medical imaging technique for visual-\\nizing the interior of a hollow organ.\\nEsophagus—The tube in the body which takes food\\nfrom the mouth to the stomach.\\nEsophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)—An imaging\\ntest that involves visually examining the lining of\\nthe esophagus, stomach, and upper duodenum with\\na flexible fiberoptic endoscope.\\nPortal hypertension—Portal hypertension forces the\\nblood flow backward, causing the portal veins to\\nenlarge and the emergence of bleeding varices\\nacross the esophagus and stomach from the pressure\\nin the portal vein. Portal hypertension is most com-\\nmonly caused by cirrhosis, but can also be seen in\\nportal vein obstruction from unknown causes.\\nPortal veins—The main veins that carry blood from\\nthe stomach and intestines to the liver.\\nShock—A state of depression of the vital processes\\nof the body characterized by pallor, a rapid and\\nweak pulse, rapid and shallow respiration, and low-\\nered blood pressure. Shock results from severe trau-\\nma, such as crushing injuries, hemorrhage, burns,\\nor major surgery.\\nTransjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt\\n(TIPS)—A transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic\\nshunt (TIPS) is a radiology procedure in which a\\ntubular device is inserted in the middle of the liver\\nto redirect the blood flow.\\nVarices—A type of varicose vein that develops in\\nveins in the linings of the esophagus and upper stom-\\nach when these veins fill with blood and swell due to\\nan increase in blood pressure in the portal veins.\\n• excessive thirst\\n• nausea\\n• vomiting\\n• and blood in the vomit\\nIf bleeding from the varices is severe, a patient may\\ngo into shock from the loss of blood, characterized by\\npallor, a rapid and weak pulse, rapid and shallow respira-\\ntion, and lowered systemic blood pressure.\\nDiagnosis\\nBleeding varices may be suspected in a patient who\\nhas any of the above-mentioned symptoms, and who has\\neither been diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver or who\\nhas a history of prolonged alcohol abuse. The definitive\\ndiagnosis is established via a specialized type of endo-\\nscopy, namely,esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), a\\nprocedure that involves the visual examination of the lin-\\ning of the esophagus, stomach, and upper duodenum\\nwith a flexible fiberoptic endoscope.\\nTreatment\\nThe objective during treatment of bleeding varices is\\nto stop and/or prevent bleeding and to restore/maintain\\nnormal blood circulation throughout the body.

Definitive treatment is usually\\nendoscopic, with the endoscope used to locate the sites of\\nthe bleeding. An instrument, inserted along with the endo-\\nscope, is used either to inject these sites with a clotting\\nagent or to tie off the bleeding sites with tiny rubber bands.\\nRepeated endoscopic treatments (usually four to six)\\nare generally required to eliminate the varices and to pre-\\nvent the recurrence of bleeding. These endoscopic tech-\\nniques are successful in about 90 percent of cases.\\nPatients who cannot be treated endoscopically may\\nbe considered for an alternative procedure called TIPS\\n(transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt). This pro-\\ncedure involves placing a hollow metal tube (shunt) in\\nthe liver connecting the portal veins with the hepatic\\nveins (veins that leave the liver and drain to the heart).\\nThis shunt lowers the pressure in the portal veins and\\nprevents bleeding and portal hypertension. The TIPS pro-\\ncedure is performed by a radiologist and has become an\\naccepted method for reducing portal vein pressure since\\n1992. Although the procedure continues to evolve, TIPS\\ncan routinely be created in more than 93% of patients.\\nMedications aimed at controlling bleeding may also\\nbe prescribed. These include propanolol, vasopressin,\\noctreotide acetate, and isosorbide mononitrate.\\nAlternative treatment\\nSome alternative treatments are aimed at preventing\\nthe cirrhosis of the liver that often causes bleeding varices\\nand most are effective. However, once a patient has\\nreached the bleeding varice stage, standard intervention to\\nstop the bleeding is required or the patient may die.\\nPrognosis\\nBleeding varices represent one of the most feared\\ncomplications of portal hypertension. They contribute to\\nthe estimated 32,000 deaths per year attributed to cirrho-\\nsis. Half or more of patients who survive episodes of\\nbleeding varices are at risk of renewed esophageal bleed-\\ning during the first one to two years. The risk of recur-\\nrence can be lowered by endoscopic and drug treatment.\\nPrognosis is usually more related to the underlying liver\\ndisease. Approximately 30 to 50 percent of people with\\nbleeding varices will die from this condition within the\\nsix weeks of the first bleeding episode.\\nPrevention\\nThe best way to possibly prevent the development or\\nrecurrence of bleeding varices is to eliminate the risk fac-\\ntors for cirrhosis of the liver. The most common cause of\\ncirrhosis is prolonged alcohol abuse, and alcohol con-\\nsumption must be completely eliminated. People with\\nhepatitis B or hepatitis C also have an increased risk of\\ndeveloping cirrhosis of the liver.

The sur-\\ngeon will want to know about any history of thyroid dis-\\nease,hypertension , or eye problems, which may\\nincrease the risk of complications.\\nDescription\\nBlepharoplasty can be performed on the upper or\\nlower eyelid; it can involve the removal of excess skin\\nand fat deposits and the tightening of selected muscles\\nsurrounding the eyelids. The goal is to provide a more\\nyouthful appearance.\\nThe surgeon will begin by deciding whether excess\\nskin, fat deposits, or muscle looseness are at fault. While\\nthe patient is sitting upright, the surgeon will mark on the\\nskin where incisions will be made. Care will be taken to\\nhide the incision lines in the natural skin folds above and\\nbelow the eye. The patient then receives injections of a\\nlocal anesthetic to numb the pain. Many surgeons also give\\nthe patient a sedative intravenously during the procedure.\\nAfter a small, crescent-shaped section of eyelid skin\\nis removed, the surgeon will work to tease out small\\npockets of fat that have collected in the lids. If muscle\\nlooseness is also a problem, the surgeon may trim tissue\\nor add a stitch to pull it tighter. Then the incision is\\nclosed with stitches.\\nIn some patients, fat deposits in the lower eyelid may\\nbe the only or primary problem. Such patients may be\\ngood candidates for transconjunctival blepharoplasty. In\\nthis procedure the surgeon makes no incision on the sur-\\nface of the eyelid, but instead enters from behind to tease\\nout the fat deposits from a small incision. The advantage\\nof this procedure is that there is no visible scar.\\nPreparation\\nPrior to surgery, patients meet with their surgeon to\\ndiscuss the procedure, clarify the results that can be\\nachieved, and discuss the potential problems that might\\noccur. Having realistic expectations is important in any\\ncosmetic procedure. Patients will learn, for example, that\\nalthough blepharoplasty can improve the appearance of\\nthe eyelid, other procedures, such as a chemical peel,\\nwill be necessary to reduce the appearance of wrinkles\\naround the eye. Some surgeons prescribe vitamin C and\\nvitamin K for 10 days prior to surgery in the belief that\\nthis helps the healing process.

Ice-\\ncold compresses are applied to the eyes continuously for\\nthe first day following surgery, and several times a day for\\nthe next week or so, to reduce swelling.

Patients should avoid aspirin or alcoholic bev-\\nerages for one week and should limit their activities,\\nincluding bending, straining, and lifting.

Patients can generally\\nreturn to their usual activities within a week to 10 days.\\nRisks\\nAs with any surgical procedure, blepharoplasty can\\nlead to infection and scarring. Good care of the wound fol-\\nlowing surgery can minimize these risks. In cases where\\ntoo much skin is removed from the eyelids, the patient\\nmay have difficulty closing his eyes. Dry eye syndrome\\nmay develop, requiring the use of artificial tears to lubri-\\ncate the eye. In a rare complication, called retrobulbar\\nhematoma, a pocket of blood forms behind the eyeball.\\nNormal results\\nMost patients can expect good results from blepharo-\\nplasty, with the removal of excess eyelid skin and fat pro-\\nducing a more youthful appearance.

It involves determining\\nthe numbers, concentrations, and conditions of the differ-\\nent types of blood cells.\\nPurpose\\nThe CBC is a useful screening and diagnostic test\\nthat is often done as part of a routine physical examina-\\ntion. It can provide valuable information about the blood\\nand blood-forming tissues (especially the bone marrow),\\nas well as other body systems. Abnormal results can indi-\\ncate the presence of a variety of conditions—including\\nanemias, leukemias, and infections—sometimes before\\nthe patient experiences symptoms of the disease.\\nDescription\\nA complete blood count is actually a series of tests\\nin which the numbers of red blood cells, white blood\\ncells, and platelets in a given volume of blood are count-\\ned. The CBC also measures the hemoglobin content and\\nthe packed cell volume (hematocrit ) of the red blood\\ncells, assesses the size and shape of the red blood cells,\\nand determines the types and percentages of white blood\\ncells. Components of the complete blood count (hemo-\\nglobin, hematocrit, white blood cells, platelets, etc.) can\\nalso be tested separately, and are sometimes done that\\nway when a doctor wants to monitor a specific condition,\\nsuch as the white cell count of a patient diagnosed with\\nleukemia, or the hemoglobin of a patient who has recent-\\nly received a blood transfusion . Because of its value,\\nthough, as an indicator of a person’s overall health, the\\nCBC package is most frequently ordered.\\nThe blood count is performed relatively inexpen-\\nsively and quickly. Most laboratories routinely use some\\ntype of automated equipment to dilute the blood, sample\\na measured volume of the diluted suspension, and count\\nthe cells in that volume. In addition to counting actual\\nnumbers of red cells, white cells, and platelets, the auto-\\nmated cell counters also measure the hemoglobin and\\ncalculate the hematocrit and the red blood cell indices\\n(measures of the size and hemoglobin content of the red\\nblood cells). Technologists then examine a stained blood\\nsmear under the microscope to identify any abnormali-\\nties in the appearance of the red blood cells and to report\\nthe types and percentages of white blood cells observed.\\nThe red blood cell (RBC) count determines the total\\nnumber of red cells (erythrocytes) in a sample of blood.\\nThe red cells, the most numerous of the cellular ele-\\nments, carry oxygen from the lungs to the body’s tissues.\\nHemoglobin (Hgb) is the protein-iron compound in the\\nred blood cells that enables them to transport oxygen. Its\\nconcentration corresponds closely to the RBC count.\\nAlso closely tied to the RBC and hemoglobin values is\\nthe hematocrit (Hct), which measures the percentage of\\nred blood cells in the total blood volume. The hematocrit\\n(expressed as percentage points) is normally about three\\ntimes the hemoglobin concentration (reported as grams\\nper deciliter).\\nRed blood cell indices provide information about the\\nsize and hemoglobin content of the red cells. They are\\nuseful in differentiating types of anemias. The indices\\ninclude four measurements that are calculated using the\\nRBC count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit results. Mean\\ncorpuscular volume (MCV) is a measurement of the aver-\\nage size of the red blood cells and indicates whether that\\nis small, large or normal. The red blood cell distribution\\nwidth (RDW) is an indication of the variation in RBC\\nsize. Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) measures the\\naverage amount (weight) of hemoglobin within a red\\nblood cell. A similar measurement, mean corpuscular\\nhemoglobin concentration (MCHC), expresses the aver-\\nage concentration of hemoglobin in the red blood cells.\\nThe white blood cell (WBC) count determines the\\ntotal number of white cells (leukocytes) in the blood\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 521\\nBlood count\\nA white blood cell.

There are\\nfive main types of white cells (neutrophils, lymphocytes,\\nmonocytes, eosinophils, and basophils), each of which\\nplays a different role in responding to the presence of\\nforeign organisms in the body. A differential white cell\\ncount is done by staining a smear of the patient’s blood\\nwith a Wright’s stain, allowing the different types of\\nwhite cells to be clearly seen under the microscope. A\\ntechnologist then counts a minimum of 100 WBCs and\\nreports each type of white cell as a percentage of the total\\nwhite blood cells counted.\\nThe platelet count is an actual count of the number\\nof platelets (thrombocytes) in a given volume of blood.\\nPlatelets, the smallest of the cellular elements of blood,\\nare involved in blood clotting.

If a microorganism is\\nfound, more testing is done to determine the antibiotics\\nthat will be effective in treating the infection.\\nPurpose\\nBacteremia is a serious clinical condition and can\\nlead to death. To give the best chance for effective treat-\\nment and survival, a blood culture is done as soon as an\\ninfection is suspected.\\nSymptoms of bacteremia are fever, chills, mental\\nconfusion, anxiety , rapid heart beat, hyperventilation,\\nblood clotting problems, and shock. These symptoms are\\nespecially significant in a person who already has anoth-\\ner illness or infection, is hospitalized, or has trouble\\nfighting infections because of a weak immune system.\\nOften, the blood infection results from an infection\\nsomewhere else in the body that has now spread.\\nAdditionally, blood cultures are done to find the\\ncauses of other infections. These include bacterial pneu-\\nmonia (an infection of the lung), and infectious endo-\\ncarditis (an infection of the inner layer of the heart).\\nBoth of these infections leak bacteria into the blood.\\nAfter a blood infection has been diagnosed, con-\\nfirmed by culture, and treated, an additional blood cul-\\nture may be done to make sure the infection is gone.\\nDescription\\nCulture strategies\\nThere are many variables involved in performing a\\nblood culture.

Each\\nspecific type of culture is handled differently by the labo-\\nratory. Most blood cultures test for both aerobic and\\nanaerobic microbes. Fungal, viral, and mycobacterial\\nblood cultures can also be done, but are less common.\\nThe physician must also decide how many blood\\ncultures should be done. One culture is rarely enough,\\nbut two to three are usually adequate. Four cultures are\\noccasionally required. Some factors influencing this\\ndecision are the specific microorganisms the physician\\nexpects to find based on the person’s symptoms or previ-\\nous culture results, and whether or not the person has had\\nrecent antibiotic therapy.\\nThe time at which the cultures are to be drawn is\\nanother decision made by the physician. During most\\nblood infections (called intermittent bacteremia) microor-\\nganisms enter the blood at various time intervals. Blood\\ndrawn randomly may miss the microorganisms. Since\\nmicroorganisms enter the blood 30–90 minutes before the\\nperson’s fever spikes, collecting the culture just after the\\nfever spike offers the best likelihood of finding the\\nmicroorganism. The second and third cultures may be\\ncollected at the same time, but from different places on\\nthe person, or spaced at 30-minute or one-hour intervals,\\nas the physician chooses. During continuous bacteremia,\\nsuch as infective endocarditis, microorganisms are always\\nin the blood and the timing of culture collection is less\\nimportant. Blood cultures should always be collected\\nbefore antibiotic treatment has begun.\\nLaboratory analysis\\nBacteria are the most common microorganisms\\nfound in blood infections. Laboratory analysis of a bacte-\\nrial blood culture differs slightly from that of a fungal\\nculture and significantly from that of a viral culture.\\nBlood is drawn from a person and put directly into a\\nblood culture bottle containing a nutritional broth. After\\nthe laboratory receives the blood culture bottle, several\\nprocesses must be completed:\\n• provide an environment for the bacteria to grow\\n• detect the growth when it occurs\\n• identify the bacteria that grow\\n• test the bacteria against certain antibiotics to determine\\nwhich antibiotic will be effective\\nThere are several types of systems, both manual and\\nautomated, available to laboratories to carry out these\\nprocesses.\\nThe broth in the blood culture bottle is the first step\\nin creating an environment in which bacteria will grow. It\\ncontains all the nutrients that bacteria need to grow. If the\\nphysician expects anaerobic bacteria to grow, oxygen\\nwill be kept out of the blood culture bottle; if aerobes are\\nexpected, oxygen will be allowed in the bottle.\\nThe bottles are placed in an incubator and kept at\\nbody temperature. They are watched daily for signs of\\ngrowth, including cloudiness or a color change in the\\nbroth, gas bubbles, or clumps of bacteria. When there is\\nevidence of growth, the laboratory does a gram stain and\\na subculture. To do the gram stain, a drop of blood is\\nremoved from the bottle and placed on a microscope\\nslide. The blood is allowed to dry and then is stained with\\npurple and red stains and examined under the micro-\\nscope. If bacteria are seen, the color of stain they picked\\nup (purple or red), their shape (such as round or rectan-\\ngular), and their size provide valuable clues as to what\\ntype of microorganism they are and what antibiotics\\nmight work best. To do the subculture, a drop of blood is\\nplaced on a culture plate, spread over the surface, and\\nplaced in an incubator.\\nIf there is no immediate visible evidence of growth\\nin the bottles, the laboratory looks for bacteria by doing\\ngram stains and subcultures. These steps are repeated\\ndaily for the first several days and periodically after that.\\nWhen bacteria grows, the laboratory identifies it\\nusing biochemical tests and the gram stain. Sensitivity\\ntesting, also called antibiotic susceptibility testing, is also\\ndone. The bacteria are tested against many different\\nantibiotics to see which antibiotics can effectively kill it.\\nAll information is passed on to the physician as soon\\nas it is known. An early report, known as a preliminary\\nreport, is usually available after one day. This report will\\ntell if any bacteria have been found yet, and if so, the\\nresults of the gram stain. The next preliminary report may\\ninclude a description of the bacteria growing on the sub-\\nculture. The laboratory notifies the physician immediately\\nwhen an organism is found and as soon as sensitivity tests\\nare complete. Sensitivity tests may be complete before the\\nbacteria is completely identified. The final report may not\\nbe available for five to seven days. If bacteria was found,\\nthe report will include its complete identification and a\\nlist of the antibiotics to which the bacteria is sensitive.\\nOne automated system is considered one of the most\\nimportant recent technical advances in blood cultures. It\\nis called continuous-monitoring blood culture systems\\n(CMCCS). The instruments automatically monitor the\\nbottles containing the patient blood for evidence of\\nmicroorganisms, usually every 10 minutes. Many data\\npoints are collected daily for each bottle, and fed into a\\ncomputer for analysis. Sophisticated mathematical calcu-\\nlations can determine when microorganisms have grown.\\nThis, combined with more frequent blood tests, make it\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 523\\nBlood culture\\nGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 523'),\n",

People preparing for elective surgery\\nmay donate their own blood to be held and then returned\\nto them during surgery. This is known as autologous\\nblood donation. Directed donor blood has been donated\\nby someone known to the intended recipient, such as a\\nfamily member or friend.\\nEach year, more than four million Americans receive\\nblood transfusions involving more than 26 million units\\nof blood (one unit equals 450 milliliters, or about one\\npint), or an average of about 32,000 units per day. All of\\nthat blood must be collected, tested, prepared, stored, and\\ndelivered to the appropriate sites. Roughly eight million\\npeople in the United States donate blood each year; about\\nhalf of the total amount needed is provided by the 36\\nregional blood centers of the American Red Cross.\\nWhole blood and the various blood components have\\nmany uses. Red blood cells, which carry oxygen, are used\\nto treat anemia. Platelets, which play a role in controlling\\nbleeding, are commonly used in the treatment of\\nleukemia and other cancers. Fresh frozen plasma is also\\nused to control bleeding in people deficient in certain\\nclotting factors. Cryoprecipitated AHF, made from fresh\\nfrozen plasma, contains a few specific clotting factors.\\nPrecautions\\nTo ensure the safety of the blood supply, a multi-\\ntiered process of donor screening and deferral is\\nemployed. This involves donor education, taking a\\ndetailed health history of each prospective donor, and\\ngiving potential donors a simple physical examination\\n(which includes taking a few drops of blood to test for\\nanemia). At any point in the process, a potential donor\\nmay be “deferred,” or judged ineligible to donate blood.\\nThis deferral may be temporary or permanent, depending\\non the reason. Potential donors are also encouraged to\\n“self-defer,” or voluntarily decline to donate, rather than\\nput future blood recipients at risk.\\nAll donated blood is extensively tested before being\\nused. The first step is determining the blood type, which\\nindicates who can receive the blood. Receiving the wrong\\ntype of blood can cause death. Blood is also screened for\\nany antibodies that could cause complications for recipi-\\nents. In addition, blood is tested to screen out donors\\ninfected with the following diseases: Hepatitis B surface\\nantigen ADD, hepatitis B core antibody,hepatitis C virus\\nantibody, HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibody, HIV p24 antigen,\\nHTLV-I and HTLV-II antibodies, and syphilis. Nucleic\\nAcid Amplification testing is also performed, and other\\ntests may be done if a doctor requests them.\\nIn order to detect the greatest possible number of\\ninfections, these screening tests are extremely sensitive.\\nFor this reason, however, donors sometimes receive false\\npositive test results. In these cases, more specific confir-\\nmatory tests are performed, to help rule out false positive\\nresults. Blood found to be abnormal is discarded, and all\\nitems coming into direct contact with donors are used\\nonly once and then discarded. Donors of infected blood\\nare entered into the Donor Deferral Register, a confiden-\\ntial national data base used to prevent deferred people\\nfrom donating blood.\\nIn general, blood donors must be at least 17 years\\nold (some states allow younger people to donate blood\\nwith their parents’ consent), must weigh at least 110\\npounds (50 kg), and must be in good health.\\nMany factors can temporarily or permanently dis-\\nqualify potential donors. Most of them have to do with\\nhaving engaged in behaviors that put them at risk of\\ninfection or having spent time in certain specified areas.\\nAmong these factors are having had a tattoo, having had\\nsex with people in high-risk groups, having had certain\\ndiseases, and having been raped.\\nDescription\\nThere are eight different blood types in all—four\\nABO groups, each of which may be either Rh positive or\\nRh negative. These types, and their approximate distribu-\\ntion in the U.S. population, are as follows: O+ (38%), O-\\n(7%), A+ (34%), A- (6%), B+ (9%), B- (2%), AB+ (3%),\\nAB- (1%). In an emergency, anyone can safely receive\\ntype O red blood cells, and people with this blood type are\\nknown as “universal donors. “ People with type AB blood,\\nknown as “universal recipients,” can receive any type of\\nred blood cells and can give plasma to all blood types.\\nBlood donations can be made in community blood\\ncenters, at hospitals or in bloodmobiles, which visit\\nschools, churches and workplaces. The actual process of\\ndonating whole blood takes about 20 minutes. A sterile\\nneedle is inserted into a vein in the donor’s arm. The\\nblood flows through plastic tubing into a blood bag.\\nDonors may be asked to clench their fist to encourage\\nblood to flow. Usually, one unit of blood is collected.\\nAfterward, donors are escorted to an observation area,\\ngiven light refreshments, and allowed to rest.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 525\\nBlood donation and registry\\nGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 525'),\n",

The\\ntest also indicates how well the lungs and kidneys are\\ninteracting to maintain normal blood pH (acid-base bal-\\nance). Blood gas studies are usually done to assess respi-\\nratory disease and other conditions that may affect the\\nlungs, and to manage patients receiving oxygen therapy\\n(respiratory therapy). In addition, the acid-base compo-\\nnent of the test provides information on kidney function.\\nDescription\\nBlood gas analysis is performed on blood from an\\nartery. It measures the partial pressures of oxygen and\\ncarbon dioxide in the blood, as well as oxygen content,\\noxygen saturation, bicarbonate content, and blood pH.\\nOxygen in the lungs is carried to the tissues through\\nthe bloodstream, but only a small amount of this oxygen\\ncan actually dissolve in arterial blood. How much dis-\\nsolves depends on the partial pressure of the oxygen (the\\npressure that the gas exerts on the walls of the arteries).\\nTherefore, testing the partial pressure of oxygen is actu-\\nally measuring how much oxygen the lungs are deliver-\\ning to the blood. Carbon dioxide is released into the\\nblood as a by-product of cell metabolism. The partial\\ncarbon dioxide pressure indicates how well the lungs are\\neliminating this carbon dioxide.\\nThe remainder of oxygen that is not dissolved in the\\nblood combines with hemoglobin, a protein—iron com-\\npound found in the red blood cells. The oxygen content\\nmeasurement in an ABG analysis indicates how much\\noxygen is combined with the hemoglobin. A related\\nvalue is the oxygen saturation, which compares the\\namount of oxygen actually combined with hemoglobin to\\nthe total amount of oxygen that the hemoglobin is capa-\\nble of combining with.\\nCarbon dioxide dissolves more readily in the blood\\nthan oxygen does, primarily forming bicarbonate and\\nsmaller amounts of carbonic acid. When present in nor-\\nmal amounts, the ratio of carbonic acid to bicarbonate\\ncreates an acid-base balance in the blood, helping to keep\\nthe pH at a level where the body’s cellular functions are\\nmost efficient. The lungs and kidneys both participate in\\nmaintaining the carbonic acid-bicarbonate balance. The\\nlungs control the carbonic acid level and the kidneys reg-\\nulate the bicarbonate. If either organ is not functioning\\nproperly, an acid-base imbalance can result. Determina-\\ntion of bicarbonate and pH levels, then, aids in diagnos-\\ning the cause of abnormal blood gas values.\\nThe procedure\\nThe blood sample is obtained by arterial puncture (usu-\\nally in the wrist, although it could be in the groin or arm) or\\nfrom an arterial line already in place. If a puncture is need-\\ned, the skin over the artery is cleaned with an antiseptic. A\\ntechnician then collects the blood with a small sterile needle\\nattached to a disposable syringe. The patient may feel a\\nbrief throbbing or cramping at the site of the puncture. After\\nthe blood is drawn, the sample must be transported to the\\nlaboratory as soon as possible for analysis.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 527\\nBlood gas analysis\\nA blood gas analyzer from Corning Corporation.(Photo-\\ngraph by Hank Morgan, Photo Researchers, Inc.

A person with diabetes mellitus either does\\nnot make enough insulin, or makes insulin that does not\\nwork properly. The result is blood sugar that remains\\nhigh, a condition called hyperglycemia.\\nDiabetes must be diagnosed as early as possible. If\\nleft untreated, it can damage or cause failure of the eyes,\\nkidneys, nerves, heart, blood vessels, and other body\\norgans. Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, may also be\\ndiscovered through blood sugar testing. Hypoglycemia is\\ncaused by various hormone disorders and liver disease,\\nas well as by too much insulin.\\nDescription\\nThere are a variety of ways to measure a person’s\\nblood sugar.\\nWhole blood glucose test\\nWhole blood glucose testing can be performed by a\\nperson in his or her home, and kits are available for this\\npurpose. The person pricks his or her finger (a finger\\nstick) with a sterile sharp blade from the kit. A single\\ndrop of blood is placed on a strip in a portable instrument\\ncalled a glucometer. The glucometer quickly determines\\nthe blood sugar and shows the results on a small screen\\nin usually a few seconds.\\nFasting plasma glucose test\\nThe fasting plasma glucose test is done on an empty\\nstomach. For the eight hours before the test, the person\\nmust fast (nothing to eat or drink, except water). The per-\\nson’s blood is drawn from a vein by a healthcare worker.\\nThe blood sample is collected into a tube containing an\\nanticoagulant. Anticoagulants stop the blood from clot-\\nting. In the laboratory, the tube of blood spins at high\\nspeed within a machine called a centrifuge. The blood\\ncells sink to the bottom and the liquid stays on the top.\\nThis straw-colored liquid on the top is the plasma. To\\nmeasure the glucose, a person’s plasma is combined with\\nother substances. From the resulting reaction, the amount\\nof glucose in the plasma is determined.\\nOral glucose tolerance test\\nThe oral glucose tolerance test is done to see how\\nwell the body handles a standard amount of glucose. This\\ntest measures the amount of glucose in a person’s plasma\\nbefore and two hours after drinking a large premeasured\\nbeverage containing glucose. The person must eat a con-\\nsistent diet, containing at least 5.25oz (150 g) of carbohy-\\ndrates each day, for three days before this test. For eight\\nhours before the test, the person must fast. A healthcare\\nprovider draws the first sample of blood at the end of the\\nfast to determine the glucose level at the start of the test.\\nThe healthcare provider then gives the person a beverage\\ncontaining 2.6 oz (75 g) of glucose. Two hours later, the\\nperson’s blood is drawn again. These blood samples are\\ncentrifuged and processed in the laboratory. A doctor can\\nthen compare the before and after glucose levels to see\\nhow well the body processed the sugar.\\nTwo-hour postprandial blood glucose test\\nThe two-hour postprandial blood glucose test mea-\\nsures the amount of glucose in plasma after a person eats\\na specific meal containing a certain amount of sugar.\\nAlthough the meal follows a predetermined menu, it is\\ndifficult to control many factors associated with this test-\\ning method.\\nBlood sugar tests can be used in a variety of situa-\\ntions including:\\n• Testing people suspected for diabetes. The American\\nDiabetic Association (ADA) recommends that either a\\nfasting plasma glucose test or an oral glucose tolerance\\ntest be used to diagnose diabetes. If the person already\\nhas symptoms of diabetes, a blood glucose test without\\nfasting (called a casual plasma glucose test) may be\\ndone. If the test result is abnormal, it must be confirmed\\nwith another test performed on another day. The two\\ntests can be different or they can be the same, but they\\nmust be done on different days. If the second test is also\\nabnormal, the person has diabetes. A two-hour post-\\nprandial test is not recommended by the ADA as a test\\nto use for the diagnosis of diabetes. A doctor may order\\nthis test, and follow it with the oral glucose tolerance\\ntest or the fasting plasma glucose test if the results are\\nabnormal.\\n• Testing pregnant women. Diabetes that occurs during\\npregnancy (gestational diabetes ) is dangerous for\\nboth the mother and the baby. Women who may be at\\nrisk are screened when they are 24-28 weeks pregnant.\\nA woman is considered at risk if she is older than 25\\nyears, is not at her normal body weight, has a parent or\\nsibling with diabetes, or if she is in an ethnic group that\\nhas a high rate of diabetes (Hispanics, Native Ameri-\\ncans, Asians, African Americans). The blood sugar test\\nto screen for gestational diabetes is a variation of the\\noral glucose tolerance test. Fasting is not required. If\\nthe result is abnormal, a more complete test is done on\\nanother day.\\n• Testing healthy people. Healthy people without symp-\\ntoms of diabetes should be screened for diabetes when\\nthey are 45 years old and again every three years. Either\\nthe fasting plasma glucose or oral glucose tolerance test\\nis used for screening. People in high risk groups should\\nbe tested before the age of 45 and tested more frequently.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 529\\nBlood sugar tests\\nGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 529'),\n",

If the person needs a blood transfu-\\nsion, another test called crossmatching is done after the\\nblood is typed to find blood from a donor that the per-\\nson’s body will accept.\\nPurpose\\nBlood typing and crossmatching are most common-\\nly done to make certain that a person who needs a trans-\\nfusion will receive blood that matches (is compatible\\nwith) his own. People must receive blood of the same\\nblood type, otherwise, a serious, even fatal, transfusion\\nreaction can occur.\\nParents who are expecting a baby have their blood\\ntyped to diagnose and prevent hemolytic disease of the\\nnewborn (HDN), a type of anemia also known as ery-\\nthroblastosis fetalis . Babies who have a blood type dif-\\nferent from their mothers are at risk for developing this\\ndisease. The disease is serious with certain blood type\\ndifferences, but is milder with others.\\nA child inherits factors or genes from each parent\\nthat determine his blood type. This fact makes blood typ-\\ning useful in paternity testing. To determine whether or\\nnot the alleged father could be the true father, the blood\\ntypes of the child, mother, and alleged father are com-\\npared.\\nLegal investigations may require typing of blood or\\nother body fluids, such as semen or saliva, to identify\\npersons involved in crimes or other legal matters.\\nDescription\\nBlood typing and crossmatching tests are performed\\nin a blood bank laboratory by technologists trained in\\nblood bank and transfusion services. The tests are done\\non blood, after it has separated into cells and serum\\n(serum is the yellow liquid left after the blood clots.)\\nCosts for both tests are covered by insurance when the\\ntests are determined to be medically necessary.\\nBlood bank laboratories are usually located in facili-\\nties, such as those operated by the American Red Cross,\\nthat collect, process, and supply blood that is donated, as\\nwell as in facilities, such as most hospitals, that prepare\\nblood for transfusion. These laboratories are regulated by\\nthe United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\\nand are often inspected and accredited by a professional\\nassociation such as the American Association of Blood\\nBanks (AABB).\\nBlood typing and crossmatching tests are based on\\nthe reaction between antigens and antibodies. An antigen\\ncan be anything that causes the body to launch an attack,\\nknown as an immune response, against it. The attack\\nbegins when the body builds a special protein, called an\\nantibody, that is uniquely designed to attack and make\\nineffective (neutralize) the specific antigen that caused\\nthe attack. A person’s body normally doesn’t make anti-\\nbodies against its own antigens, only against antigens\\nthat are foreign to it.\\nA person’s body contains many antigens. The anti-\\ngens found on the surface of red blood cells are impor-\\ntant because they determine a person’s blood type. When\\nred blood cells having a certain blood type antigen are\\nmixed with serum containing antibodies against that anti-\\ngen, the antibodies attack and stick to the antigen. In a\\ntest tube, this reaction is observed as the formation of\\nclumps of cells (clumping).\\nWhen blood is typed, a person’s cells and serum are\\nmixed in a test tube with commercially-prepared serum\\nand cells. Clumping tells which antigens or antibodies\\nare present and reveals the person’s blood type. When\\nblood is crossmatched, patient serum is mixed with cells\\nfrom donated blood that might be used for transfusion.\\nClumping or lack of clumping in the test tube tells\\nwhether or not the blood is compatible.\\nAlthough there are over 600 known red blood cell\\nantigens, organized into 22 blood group systems, routine\\nblood typing and crossmatching is usually concerned\\nwith only two systems: the ABO and Rh blood group\\nsystems.\\nBlood typing\\nABO BLOOD GROUP SYSTEM. In 1901, Karl Land-\\nsteiner, an Austrian pathologist, randomly combined the\\nserum and red blood cells of his colleagues. From the\\nreactions he observed in test tubes, he discovered the\\nABO blood group system. This discovery earned him the\\n1930 Nobel Prize in Medicine.\\nA person’s ABO blood type—A, B, AB, or O—is\\nbased on the presence or absence of the A and B antigens\\non his red blood cells. The A blood type has only the A\\nantigen and the B blood type has only the B antigen. The\\nAB blood type has both A and B antigens, and the O\\nblood type has neither A nor B antigen.\\nBy the time a person is six months old, he naturally\\nwill have developed antibodies against the antigens his\\nred blood cells lack. That is, a person with A blood type\\nwill have anti-B antibodies, and a person with B blood\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 531\\nBlood typing and crossmatching\\nGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 531'),\n",

A person with AB blood\\ntype will have neither antibody, but a person with O\\nblood type will have both anti-A and anti-B antibodies.\\nAlthough the distribution of each of the four ABO blood\\ntypes varies between racial groups, O is the most com-\\nmon and AB is the least common.\\nABO typing is the first test done on blood when it is\\ntested for transfusion. A person must receive ABO-\\nmatched blood. ABO incompatibilities are the major\\ncause of fatal transfusion reactions. ABO antigens are\\nalso found on most body organs, so ABO compatibility is\\nalso important for organ transplants.\\nAn ABO incompatibility between a pregnant woman\\nand her baby is a minor cause of HDN and usually causes\\nno problem for the baby. The structure of ABO antibod-\\nies makes it unlikely they will cross the placenta to attack\\nthe baby’s red blood cells.\\nPaternity testing compares the ABO blood types of\\nthe child, mother, and alleged father. The alleged father\\ncan’t be the true father if the child’s blood type requires a\\ngene that neither he nor the mother have. For example, a\\nchild with blood type B whose mother has blood type O,\\nrequires a father with either AB or B blood type; a man\\nwith blood type O cannot be the true father.\\nIn some people, ABO antigens can be found in body\\nfluids other than blood, such as saliva and semen. ABO\\ntyping of these fluids provides clues in legal investigations.\\nRH BLOOD GROUP SYSTEM. The Rh, or Rhesus,\\nsystem was first detected in 1940 by Landsteiner and\\nWiener when they injected blood from rhesus monkeys\\ninto guinea pigs and rabbits. More than 50 antigens have\\nsince been discovered belonging to this system, making\\nit the most complex red blood cell antigen system.\\nIn routine blood typing and crossmatching tests,\\nonly one of these 50 antigens, the D antigen, also known\\nas the Rh factor or Rho[D], is tested for. If the D antigen\\nis present, that person is Rh-positive; if the D antigen is\\nabsent, that person is Rh-negative.\\nOther important antigens in the Rh system are C, c,\\nE, and e. These antigens are not usually tested for in rou-\\ntine blood typing tests. However, testing for the presence\\nof these antigens is useful in paternity testing, and when\\na technologist tries to identify unexpected Rh antibodies\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2532\\nBlood typing and crossmatching\\nRecipient's blood\\nABO\\nantigens\\nABO\\nantibodies\\nDonor type\\nO cells\\nDonor type\\nA cells\\nDonor type\\nB cells\\nDonor type\\nAB cells\\nABO blood\\ntype\\nO\\nA\\nB\\nAB\\nNone Anti-A\\nAnti-B\\nA Anti-B\\nB Anti-A\\nA & B None\\nCompatible Not compatible\\nReactions with donor's red blood cells\\nBlood typing is a laboratory test done to discover a person’s blood type.

(Custom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by\\npermission.)\\nBoils\\nDefinition\\nBoils and carbuncles are bacterial infections of hair\\nfollicles and surrounding skin that form pustules (small\\nblister-like swellings containing pus) around the follicle.\\nBoils are sometimes called furuncles. A carbuncle is\\nformed when several furuncles merge to form a single\\ndeep abscess with several heads or drainage points.\\nDescription\\nBoils and carbuncles are firm reddish swellings about\\n0.2-0.4 in (5-10 mm) across that are slightly raised above\\nthe skin surface. They are sore to the touch. A boil usually\\nhas a visible central core of pus; a carbuncle is larger and\\nhas several visible heads. Boils occur most commonly on\\nthe face, back of the neck, buttocks, upper legs and groin\\narea, armpits, and upper torso. Carbuncles are less common\\nthan single boils; they are most likely to form at the back of\\nthe neck. Males are more likely to develop carbuncles.\\nBoils and carbuncles are common problems in the\\ngeneral population, particularly among adolescents and\\nadults. People who are more likely to develop these skin\\ninfections include those with:\\n• diabetes, especially when treated by injected insulin\\n• alcoholism or drug abuse\\n• poor personal hygiene\\n• crowded living arrangements\\n• jobs or hobbies that expose them to greasy or oily sub-\\nstances, especially petroleum products\\n• allergies or immune system disorders, including HIV\\ninfection.\\n• family members with recurrent skin infections\\nCauses and symptoms\\nBoils and carbuncles are caused by Staphylococcus\\naureus, a bacterium that causes an infection in an oil\\ngland or hair follicle. Although the surface of human skin\\nis usually resistant to bacterial infection,S. aureus can\\nenter through a break in the skin surface—including\\nbreaks caused by needle punctures for insulin or drug\\ninjections. Hair follicles that are blocked by greasy\\ncreams, petroleum jelly, or similar products are more\\nvulnerable to infection. Bacterial skin infections can be\\nspread by shared cosmetics or washcloths, close human\\ncontact, or by contact with pus from a boil or carbuncle.\\nAs the infection develops, an area of inflamed tissue\\ngradually forms a pus-filled swelling or pimple that is\\npainful to touch. As the boil matures, it forms a yellowish\\nhead or point. It may either continue to swell until the\\npoint bursts open and allows the pus to drain, or it may\\nbe gradually reabsorbed into the skin. It takes between\\none and two weeks for a boil to heal completely after it\\ncomes to a head and discharges pus. The bacteria that\\ncause the boil can spread into other areas of the skin or\\neven into the bloodstream if the skin around the boil is\\ninjured by squeezing. If the infection spreads, the patient\\nwill usually develop chills and fever, swollen lymph\\nnodes (lymphadenitis), and red lines in the skin running\\noutward from the boil.\\nFurunculosis is a word that is sometimes used to\\nrefer to recurrent boils. Many patients have repeated\\nepisodes of furunculosis that are difficult to treat because\\ntheir nasal passages carry colonies of S. aureus . These\\nbacterial colonies make it easy for the patient’s skin to be\\nreinfected. They are most likely to develop in patients\\nwith diabetes, HIV infection, or other immune system\\ndisorders.\\nCarbuncles are formed when the bacteria infect sev-\\neral hair follicles that are close together. Carbunculosis is\\na word that is sometimes used to refer to the develop-\\nment of carbuncles. The abscesses spread until they\\nmerge with each other to form a single large area of\\ninfected skin with several pus-filled heads. Patients with\\ncarbuncles may also have a low-grade fever or feel gen-\\nerally unwell.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of boils and carbuncles is usually\\nmade by the patient’s primary care doctor on the basis of\\nvisual examination of the skin. In some cases involving\\nrecurrent boils on the face, the doctor may need to con-\\nsider acne as a possible diagnosis, but for the most part\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2536\\nBoils\\nGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 536'),\n",

He or she can also culture the patient’s nasal\\ndischarge to test for the presence of a S. aureus colony.\\nTreatment\\nPatient and family education\\nPatient education is an important part of the treatment\\nof boils and carbuncles. Patients need to be warned against\\npicking at or squeezing boils because of the danger of\\nspreading the infection into other parts of the skin or\\nbloodstream. It is especially important to avoid squeezing\\nboils around the mouth or nose because infections in these\\nareas can be carried to the brain.

The specific medications that are given are usual-\\nly dicloxacillin (Dynapen) or cephalexin (Keflex). Ery-\\nthromycin may be given to patients who are allergic to\\npenicillin. The usual course of oral antibiotics is 5-10\\ndays; however, patients with recurrent furunculosis may\\nbe given oral antibiotics for longer periods. Furunculosis\\nis treated with a combination of dicloxacillin and\\nrifampin (Rifadin).\\nPatients with bacterial colonies in their nasal pas-\\nsages are often given mupirocin (Bactroban) to apply\\ndirectly to the lining of the nose.\\nSurgical treatment\\nBoils and carbuncles that are very large, or that are\\nnot draining, may be opened with a sterile needle or sur-\\ngical knife to allow the pus to drain. The doctor will usu-\\nally give the patient a local anesthetic if a knife is used;\\nsurgical treatment of boils is painful and usually leaves\\nnoticeable scars.\\nAlternative treatment\\nNaturopathic therapy\\nNaturopathic practitioners usually recommend\\nchanges in the patient’s diet as well as applying herbal\\npoultices to the infected area. The addition of zinc sup-\\nplements and vitamin A to the diet is reported to be\\neffective in treating boils. The application of a paste or\\npoultice containing goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis )\\nroot is recommended by naturopaths on the grounds\\nthat goldenseal helps to kill bacteria and reduce\\ninflammation.\\nHomeopathy\\nHomeopaths maintain that taking the proper homeo-\\npathic medication in the first stages of a boil or carbuncle\\nwill bring about early resolution of the infection and pre-\\nvent pus formation. The most likely choices are Bel-\\nladonna or Hepar sulphuris . If the boil has already\\nformed, Mercurius vivus or Silica may be recommended\\nto bring the pus to a head.\\nWestern herbal therapies\\nA variety of herbal remedies can be applied topi-\\ncally to boils to fight infection. These include essential\\noils of bergamot (Citrus bergamia ), chamomile ( Matri-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 537\\nBoils\\nA close-up view of a carbuncle on person’s back.(Photo-\\ngraph by John Watney, Photo Researchers, Inc.

Osteoporosis happens when the\\nbones lose calcium and other minerals that keep them\\nstrong. Osteoporosis begins after menopause in many\\nwomen, and worsens after age 65, often resulting in seri-\\nous fractures . These fractures may not only bring dis-\\nability, but may affect longevity. As many as one-fourth\\nof women who fracture their hip after age 50 die within\\none year.\\nMost people today will get a bone density scan from\\na machine using a technology called Dual Energy X-ray\\nAbsorptiometry or DEXA for short. This machine takes a\\npicture of the bones in the spine, hip, total body and\\nwrist, and calculates their density. If a DEXA machine is\\nnot available, bone density scans can also be done with\\ndual photon absorptiometry (measuring the spine, hip\\nand total body) and quantitative computed tomography\\nscans (measuring the spine). Bone density scanners that\\nuse DEXA technology to just measure bone density in\\nthe wrist (called pDEXA scans) provide scans at some\\ndrugstores. Yet these tests are not as accurate as those\\nthat measure density in the total body, spine or hip—\\nwhere most fractures occur.\\nPurpose\\nA bone density scan measures the strength of an\\nindividual’s bones and determines the risk of fracture. An\\nobservation of any osteoporosis present can be made.\\nDescription\\nTo take a DEXA bone density scan, the patient lies on\\na bed underneath the scanner, a curving plastic arm that\\nemits x rays. These low-dose x rays form a fan beam that\\nrotates around the patient. During the test, the scanner\\nmoves to capture images of the patient’s spine, hip or entire\\nbody. A computer then compares the patient’s bone\\nstrength and risk of fracture to that of other people in the\\nUnited States at the same age and to young people at peak\\nbone density. Bones reach peak density at age 30 and then\\nstart to lose mass. The test takes about 20 minutes to do and\\nis painless. The DEXA bone scan costs about $250. Some\\ninsurance companies and Medicare cover the cost. pDEXA\\nwrist bone scans in drugstores are available for about $30.\\nPreparation\\nThe patient puts on a hospital gown and lies on the\\nbed underneath the scanner. Not all doctors routinely\\nschedule this test. If the following factors apply to a\\npatient, they may need a bone density scan and can dis-\\ncuss this with their doctor. The patient:\\n• is at risk for osteoporosis\\n• is near menopause\\n• has broken a bone after a modest trauma\\n• has a family history of osteoporosis\\n• uses steroid or antiseizure medications\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2540\\nBone density test\\nComputer read-out of a bone density scan.(Photo\\nResearchers.

They also are used pre-\\nscribed for Paget’s disease, a painful condition that weak-\\nens and deforms bones, and they are used to control calci-\\num levels in the blood.\\nBone is living tissue. Like other tissue, bone is con-\\nstantly being broken down and replaced with new materi-\\nal. Normally, there is a balance between the breakdown\\nof old bone and its replacement with new bone. But\\nwhen something goes wrong with the process, bone dis-\\norders may result.\\nOsteoporosis is a particular concern for women\\nafter menopause, as well as for older men. In osteo-\\nporosis, the inside of the bones become porous and thin.\\nOver time, this condition weakens the bones and makes\\nthem more likely to break. Osteoporosis is four times\\nmore common in women than in men. This is because\\nwomen have less bone mass than men, tend to live\\nlonger and take in less calcium, and need the female\\nhormone estrogen to keep their bones strong. If men\\nlive long enough, they are also at risk of getting osteo-\\nporosis later in life. Once total bone mass has peaked—\\naround age 35—all adults start to lose it. In women, the\\nrate of bone loss speeds up during menopause, when\\nestrogen levels fall. Bone loss may also occur if both\\novaries are removed by surgery. Ovaries make estrogen.\\nHormone replacement therapyis one approach to\\npreventing osteoporosis. However, not all people can\\nuse hormone replacement therapy. Bone disorder drugs\\nare a good alternative for people who already have\\nosteoporosis or who are at risk of developing it. Risk\\nfactors include lack of regular exercise , early\\nmenopause, being underweight, and a strong family\\nhistory of osteoporosis.\\nDescription\\nBone disorder drugs are available only with a\\nphysician’s prescription and come in tablet, nasal\\nspray, and injectable forms. Commonly used bone dis-\\norder drugs are alendronate (Fosamax), calcitonin\\n(Miacalcin, Calcimar), and raloxifene (Evista). Ralox-\\nifene belongs to a group of drugs known as selective\\nestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), which act like\\nestrogen in some parts of the body but not in others.\\nThis makes the drugs less likely to cause some of the\\nharmful effects that estrogen may cause. Unlike estro-\\ngen, raloxifene does not increase the risk of breast\\ncancer . In fact, research suggests that raloxifene may\\neven reduce that risk.\\nRecommended dosage\\nAlendronate\\nFOR OSTEOPOROSIS. The usual dose is 10 mg once\\na day. Treatment usually continues over many years.\\nFOR PAGET’S DISEASE. The usual dose is 40 mg once\\na day for six months.\\nThis medicine works only when it is taken with a full\\nglass of water first thing in the morning, at least 30 min-\\nutes before eating or drinking anything or taking any\\nother medicine. Do not lie down for at least 30 minutes\\nafter taking it because the drug can irritate the esophagus,\\nthe tube that delivers food form the mouth to the stomach.\\nCalcitonin\\nNASAL SPRAY. The usual dose is one spray into the\\nnose once a day. Alternate nostrils, spraying the right\\nnostril one day, the left nostril the next day, and so on.\\nINJECTABLE. The recommended dosage depends on\\nthe condition for which the medicine is prescribed and\\nmay be different for different people. Check with the\\nphysician who prescribed the medicine or the pharmacist\\nwho filled the prescription for the proper dosage.\\nRaloxifene\\nThe usual dose is one 60-mg tablet daily.\\nPrecautions\\nAldendronate\\nPeople with low levels of calcium in their blood\\nshould not take this medicine. It also is not recommended\\nfor women on hormone replacement therapy or for anyone\\nwith kidney problems. Before using alendronate, anyone\\nwho has digestive or swallowing problems should make\\nsure that his or her physician knows about the condition.\\nCalcitonin\\nCalcitonin nasal spray may cause irritation or small\\nsores in the nose. Check with a physician if this becomes\\nvery uncomfortable or if there is bleeding from the nose.\\nThe injectable form of calcitonin has caused serious\\nallergic reactions in a few people. The nasal spray is not\\nknown to cause such reactions, but the possibility exists.\\nBefore starting treatment with calcitonin, the physician\\nwho prescribes the drug may order an allergy test to\\nmake sure there will not be a problem.\\nRaloxifene\\nA rare, but serious side effect of raloxifene is an\\nincreased risk of blood clots that form in the veins and\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2542\\nBone disorder drugs\\nGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 542'),\n",

Other important bone-saving\\nsteps are avoiding smoking and alcohol and getting\\nenough of the kind of exercise that puts weight on the\\nbones (such as walking or lifting weights).\\nPeople who are taking these drugs because they have\\ntoo much calcium in their blood may need to limit the\\namount of calcium in their diets. Too much calcium may pre-\\nvent the medicine from working properly. Discuss the proper\\ndiet with the physician who prescribed the drug, and do not\\nmake any diet changes without the physician’s approval.\\nAnyone who has had unusual reactions to bone dis-\\norder drugs in the past should let his or her physician\\nknow before taking the drugs again.

Bone graft is also used to\\nhelp fusion between vertebrae, correct deformities, or\\nprovide structural support for fractures of the spine. In\\naddition to fracture repair , bone graft is used to repair\\ndefects in bone caused by birth defects, traumatic injury,\\nor surgery for bone cancer.\\nDescription\\nBone is composed of a matrix, mainly made up of a\\nprotein called collagen. It is strengthened by deposits of\\ncalcium and phosphate salts, called hydroxyapatite.\\nWithin and around this matrix are located the cells of the\\nbones, which are of four types. Osteoblasts produce the\\nbone matrix. Osteocytes are mature osteoblasts and serve\\nto maintain the bone. Osteoclasts break down and\\nremove bone tissue. Bone lining cells cover bone sur-\\nfaces. Together, these four types of cells are responsible\\nfor building the bone matrix, maintaining it, and remod-\\neling the bone as needed.\\nThere are three ways in which a bone graft can help\\nrepair a defect. The first is called osteogenesis, the for-\\nmation of new bone by the cells contained within the\\ngraft. The second is osteoinduction, a chemical process\\nin which molecules contained within the graft (bone\\nmorphogenetic proteins) convert the patient’s cells into\\ncells that are capable of forming bone. The third is osteo-\\nconduction, a physical effect by which the matrix of the\\ngraft forms a scaffold on which cells in the recipient are\\nable to form new bone.\\nNew bone for grafting can be obtained from other\\nbones in the patient’s own body (e.g., hip bones or ribs),\\ncalled autograft, or from bone taken from other people\\nthat is frozen and stored in tissue banks, called allograft.\\nA variety of natural and synthetic replacement materials\\nare also used instead of bone, including collagen (the\\nprotein substance of the white fibers of the skin, bone,\\nand connective tissues); polymers, such as silicone and\\nsome acrylics; hydroxyapatite; calcium sulfate; and\\nceramics. A new material, called resorbable polymeric\\ngrafts, is also being studied. These resorbable grafts pro-\\nvide a structure for new bone to grow on; the grafts then\\nslowly dissolve, leaving only the new bone behind.\\nTo place the graft, the surgeon makes an incision in\\nthe skin over the bone defect and shapes the bone graft or\\nreplacement material to fit into the defect. After the graft\\nis placed into the defect, it is held in place with pins,\\nplates, or screws. The incision is closed with stitches and\\na splint or cast is used to prevent movement of the bones\\nwhile healing.\\nThe costs associated with a bone graft vary.

This condition is called fracture\\nnonunion, and it occurs more frequently among adults\\nthan children, in people with severe or complex fractures,\\nand in people who smoke.\\nThe theory behind applying an electric current to\\nfractures to stimulate healing is based on the fact that\\nthe concave side of the bone becomes negatively\\ncharged and the convex side is positively charged. It is\\nbelieved that artificially encouraging this charging with\\nan electric current will speed healing. In 1996, the Food\\nand Drug Administration (FDA) also approved the\\napplication of low intensity ultrasound pulses as a treat-\\nment for fracture nonunion.\\nUltrasound and electromagnetic stimulation are\\nexpensive and are used only when healing problems exist\\nfor a substantial length of time. Each method must be\\nused for at least three to six months to be effective.\\nPrecautions\\nBone growth stimulation cannot be used if the gap\\nbetween the ends of the fracture is too large.\\nDescription\\nElectric stimulation can be applied either from the\\ninside of the body (invasively) or from the outside the\\nbody (noninvasively). Ultrasound is a noninvasive pro-\\ncedure. The type of stimulation selected depends on the\\ndoctor’s preference, the type and location of the fracture,\\nand the patient’s motivation to comply with the treat-\\nment schedule. Treatment can take anywhere from three\\nto six months.\\nInvasive stimulators\\nInvasive electric stimulators are either fully or partial-\\nly implantable. The advantage of these devices is that they\\napply a direct electric current to the fracture 24 hours a\\nday. The fully implantable stimulator requires little daily\\nattention from the patient. Patients using a semi-implanted\\nstimulator must regulate their own treatment schedule and\\nhave to care for the external power pack. The disadvantage\\nof implantable and semi-implantable stimulators is that\\ntheir implantation is a surgical procedure.\\nFully implantable direct current stimulators are\\ninstalled in a hospital under general or regional anesthesia.\\nBoth the stimulator and the power source are implanted.\\nThe surgeon makes an incision and places a spiral shaped\\ncathode inside the bone. A wire leads to the power source\\nand a small anode. The power source is a battery pack that\\nis implanted in the nearby muscle. The body transmits\\nelectrical current to close the circuit. The incision is then\\nclosed. Once in place, the device provides continuous\\ndirect electric current for bone growth stimulation.\\nPartially implanted stimulators use cathode pins that\\nare implanted at the edge of each bone that is fractured.\\nWires lead to the surface of the skin where a power\\nsource and the anode are located. Wires complete the cir-\\ncuit. The external portion of the device is held in place by\\na cast. This source of stimulation also runs continuously.\\nNoninvasive stimulators\\nIn the noninvasive stimulator, external electromag-\\nnetic coils are placed on either side of the fracture and\\nare held in place by a strap or cuff. Locating the coils\\ncorrectly is important, and their location relative to the\\nfracture is usually confirmed by x rays.\\nThe coils produce a pulsating electromagnetic field.\\nIt is up to the patient to maintain the prescribed treatment\\nschedule. Effective treatment requires stimulation any-\\nwhere from three to ten hours each day in periods of no\\nless than one hour.\\nUltrasound stimulation is the most recent treatment\\nfor stimulating bone growth. A device that generates low\\nintensity pulses of sound is applied to the skin over the\\nfracture. The advantage of this technique is that it is non-\\ninvasive and the period of application of the sound pulses\\ncan be as short as 20-30 minutes each day. The results of\\nthis treatment have been studied less than the effect of\\nelectromagnetic stimulation.\\nPreparation\\nBone growth stimulation is done only when healing\\nhas failed to occur for many months. Before it is started,\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2546\\nBone growth stimulation\\nGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 546'),\n",

The patient may meet with an anesthesiologist\\nto discuss any conditions that might affect the adminis-\\ntration of anesthesia.\\nAftercare\\nIf a noninvasive, pulsating, electromagnetic field\\ndevice is used, the patient must not put any stress or\\nweight on the fracture until it is healed, which is a matter\\nof months in most cases. In all lower limb fractures,\\nregardless of the stimulation method used, the patient can\\nnot bear weight on the limb with the fracture until heal-\\ning is complete.

These blood cells are vital for normal body\\nfunctions, such as oxygen transport, defense against\\ninfection and disease, and clotting. Blood cells have a\\nlimited lifespan and are constantly being replaced; there-\\nfore, healthy stem cells are vital.\\nIn association with certain diseases, stem cells may\\nproduce too many, too few, or otherwise abnormal blood\\ncells. Also, medical treatments may destroy stem cells or\\nalter blood cell production. The resultant blood cell\\nabnormalities can be life threatening.\\nBone marrow transplantation involves extracting\\nbone marrow containing normal stem cells from a\\nhealthy donor, and transferring it to a recipient whose\\nbody cannot manufacture proper quantities of normal\\nblood cells. The goal of the transplant is to rebuild the\\nrecipient’s blood cells and immune system and hopefully\\ncure the underlying ailment.\\nPurpose\\nA person’s red blood cells, white blood cells, and\\nplatelets may be destroyed or may be abnormal due to\\ndisease. Also, certain medical therapies, particularly\\nchemotherapyor radiation treatment, may destroy a\\nperson’s stem cells. The consequence to a person’s health\\nis severe. Under normal circumstances, red blood cells\\ncarry oxygen throughout the body and remove carbon\\ndioxide from the body’s tissues. White blood cells form\\nthe cornerstone of the body’s immune system and defend\\nit against infection. Platelets limit bleeding by enabling\\nthe blood to clot if a blood vessel is damaged.\\nA bone marrow transplant is used to rebuild the\\nbody’s capacity to produce these blood cells and bring\\ntheir numbers to normal levels. Illnesses that may be\\ntreated with a bone marrow transplant include both can-\\ncerous and noncancerous diseases.\\nCancerous diseases may or may not specifically\\ninvolve blood cells; but,cancer treatment can destroy the\\nbody’s ability to manufacture new blood cells. Bone mar-\\nrow transplantation may be used in conjunction with\\nadditional treatments, such as chemotherapy, for various\\ntypes of leukemia,Hodgkin’s disease, lymphoma, breast\\nand ovarian cancer , and other cancers. Noncancerous\\ndiseases for which bone marrow transplantation can be a\\ntreatment option include aplastic anemia , sickle cell\\ndisease, thalassemia, and severe immunodeficiency.\\nPrecautions\\nBone marrow transplants are not for everyone.\\nTransplants are accompanied by a risk of infection, trans-\\nplant rejection by the recipient’s immune system, and\\nother complications. The procedure has a lower success\\nrate the greater the recipient’s age. Complications are\\nexacerbated for people whose health is already seriously\\nimpaired as in late-stage cancers. Therefore, a person’s\\nage or state of health may prohibit use of a bone marrow\\ntransplant. The typical cut-off age for a transplant ranges\\nfrom 40 to 55 years; however, a person’s general health is\\nusually the more important factor.\\nEven in the absence of complications, the transplant\\nand associated treatments are hard on the recipient. Bone\\nmarrow transplants are debilitating. A person’s ability to\\nwithstand the rigors of the transplant is a key considera-\\ntion in deciding to use this treatment.\\nDescription\\nAutologous and allogeneic transplants\\nTwo important requirements for a bone marrow\\ntransplant are the donor and the recipient. Sometimes,\\nthe donor and the recipient may be the same person. This\\ntype of transplant is called an autologous transplant. It is\\ntypically used in cases in which a person’s bone marrow\\nis generally healthy but will be destroyed due to medical\\ntreatment for diseases such as breast cancer and\\nHodgkin’s disease. Most bone marrow transplants are\\nautologous. If a person’s bone marrow is unsuitable for\\nan autologous transplant, the bone marrow must be\\nderived from another person in an allogeneic transplant.\\nAllogeneic transplants are more complicated\\nbecause of proteins called human lymphocyte antigens\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2550\\nBone marrow transplantation\\nGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 550'),\n",

If\\nthe donor and the recipient have very dissimilar antigens,\\nthe recipient’s immune system regards the donor’s bone\\nmarrow cells as invaders and launches a destructive\\nattack against them. Such an attack negates any benefits\\noffered by the transplant.\\nHLA matching\\nThere are only five major HLA classes or types—\\ndesignated HLA–A,–B, –C,–D, and class III—but much\\nvariation within the groupings. For example, HLA–A\\nfrom one individual may be similar to, but not the same\\nas, HLA–A in another individual; such a situation can\\nrender a transplant from one to the other impossible.\\nHLA matching is more likely if the donor and recip-\\nient are related, particularly if they are siblings; however,\\nan unrelated donor may be a potential match. Only in\\nrare cases is matching HLA types between two people\\nnot an issue: if the recipient has an identical twin. Identi-\\ncal twins carry the same genes; therefore, the same anti-\\ngens. A bone marrow transplant between identical twins\\nis called a syngeneic transplant.\\nPeripheral blood stem cell transplants\\nA relatively recent development in stem cell trans-\\nplantation is the use of peripheral blood cells instead of\\nstem cells from bone marrow. Peripheral blood stem cells\\n(PBSCs) are obtained from circulating blood rather than\\nfrom bone marrow, but the amount of stem cells found in\\nthe peripheral blood is much smaller than the amount of\\nstem cells found in the bone marrow. Peripheral blood\\nstem cells can be used in either autologous or allogeneic\\ntransplants. The majority of PBSC transplants are autolo-\\ngous. However, recent clinical studies indicate that\\nPBSCs are being used more frequently than bone mar-\\nrow for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.\\nThe advantages of PBSC transplants when compared\\nto bone marrow transplants are: in allogeneic transplanta-\\ntion, haematopoietic and immune recovery are faster with\\nPBSCs which reduces the potential for disease recur-\\nrence, primarily graft-versus-host-disease. In autologous\\ntransplantation, the use of PBSCs can result in faster\\nblood countrecoveries. Also, some medical conditions\\nexist in which the recipient cannot accept bone marrow\\nstem cell transplants, but can accept PBSC transplants.\\nSome possible disadvantages to PBSC transplant versus\\nbone marrow transplantation are: so much more fluid vol-\\nume is necessary to collect enough PBSCs that, at the\\ntime of infusing the new stem cells into the recipient, the\\nfluid can collect in the lungs or cause temporary kidney\\nproblems. Also, the time commitment for the donor for a\\nPBSC transplant is considerable. When the PBSCs are\\nbeing collected, several outpatient sessions are needed\\nand each session lasts approximately two–four hours.\\nThe transplant procedure\\nBONE MARROW TRANSPLANTATION. The bone mar-\\nrow extraction, or harvest, is the same whether for an autol-\\nogous or allogeneic transplant. Harvesting is done under\\ngeneral anesthesia (i.e., the donor sleeps through the proce-\\ndure), and discomfort is usually minimal afterwards. Bone\\nmarrow is drawn from the iliac crest (the part of the hip\\nbone to either side of the lower back) with a special needle\\nand a syringe. Several punctures are usually necessary to\\ncollect the needed amount of bone marrow, approximately\\n1–2 quarts (0.9-1.91). (This amount is only a small percent-\\nage of the total bone marrow and is typically replaced with-\\nin four weeks.) The donor remains at the hospital for 24–48\\nhours and can resume normal activities within a few days.\\nIf the bone marrow is meant for an autologous trans-\\nplant, it is stored at –112 to –320°F (–80 to –196°C) until\\nit is needed. Bone marrow for an allogeneic transplant is\\nsometimes treated to remove the donor’s T cells (a type\\nof white blood cell) or to remove ABO (blood type) anti-\\ngens; otherwise, it is transplanted without modification.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 551\\nBone marrow transplantation\\nIn autologous bone marrow transplantation, stem cells are\\ncollected from the patient.

A radioac-\\ntive substance is injected intravenously, and the image of\\nits distribution in the skeletal system is analyzed to detect\\ncertain diseases or conditions.\\nPurpose\\nBone scans are most frequently ordered to check\\nwhether a cancer that originated elsewhere has spread to\\nthe bones. Cancers which begin in the breasts, kidneys,\\nlungs, prostate, thyroid, or urinary bladder are most like-\\nly to spread, or metastasize, to the bones. If metastases\\nare found, periodic bone scans may be ordered to see if\\ntherapy is effective against a cancer.\\nSome cancers arise in bone. These are called primary\\nbone cancers. When an abnormality is found on an x ray of\\na bone, a bone scan may be helpful in deciding if it is a pri-\\nmary bone cancer, or a non-cancerous (benign) condition.\\nInfection in the bone (osteomyelitis) can be detected\\nor confirmed by a bone scan, often days or weeks before\\nan x ray would reveal it. Bone scans are useful in diag-\\nnosing early arthritic changes, and monitoring both the\\nprogression of the disease and the effectiveness of treat-\\nment. Unexplained pain may be evaluated with a bone\\nscan, because it can demonstrate fractures which are dif-\\nficult to detect on x ray. Bone scans can be used to see if\\nartificial joints have loosened or become infected. Sus-\\npected child abuse may be evaluated with a bone scan,\\ndue to its ability to see an overall pattern of repeated\\ntrauma. Abnormalities caused by altered circulation to\\nthe bone may be diagnosed with a bone scan.\\nPrecautions\\nWomen who are pregnant or breastfeeding should\\nnot have this test. A patient who is unable to remain still\\nfor an extended period of time may require sedation for\\na bone scan.\\nDescription\\nThis test is performed in a radiology facility, either\\nin a hospital department or an outpatient x-ray center.\\nThe patient usually sits or lies down while a radioactive\\nsubstance is injected through a vein in the arm. For a\\nbone scan, the radionuclide used is specifically chosen to\\naccumulate in the bone. The patient then waits from three\\nto four hours, for the substance to collect within the\\nskeletal system. During this time, he or she will be\\ninstructed to drink several glasses of water. Patients are\\nfree to get up and move around as they desire during this\\nwaiting time, and should urinate frequently. Just before\\nthe scanning begins, the patient should empty his or her\\nbladder again. This ensures that a lot of radioactive mate-\\nrial is not concentrated in the urinary bladder, which\\ncould obscure part of the pelvic bones.\\nDuring the scan, the patient lies on his or her back\\non a table, but may be repositioned to the stomach or side\\nduring the study. It is important for the patient not to\\nmove, except when directed to by the technologist.\\nThe radionuclide scanner, sometimes called a\\ngamma camera, or scintillation camera, is positioned\\nagainst the body part to be examined. Either the camera,\\nthe table, or both, may change position during the study.\\nFor a total body bone scan, the patient is scanned from\\nhead to foot, over a period of 30-60 minutes. Patients\\nshould experience no discomfort from this examination.\\nA special kind of bone scan, called a SPECT (Single\\nPhoton Emission Computed Tomography) scan may be\\nadded, to study a particular part of the body in more\\ndetail.

The camera circles completely\\naround the area in question or multiple cameras are used\\nto create a cross-sectional image. This helps pinpoint the\\nlocation of the abnormality being evaluated.\\nAnother variation is called a three-phase, or three-\\nstage, bone scan. The procedure is the same, except the\\nscanning takes place immediately after the radioactive\\nsubstance is injected, approximately 20 minutes after the\\ninjection, then two to four hours later.\\nPreparation\\nSome specialized blood studies should be drawn\\nbefore this study is begun. Jewelry or metallic objects\\nneed to be removed. No other special physical prepara-\\ntion is required.\\nThe patient should understand that there is no dan-\\nger of radioactive exposure to themselves or others, as\\nonly small amounts of the radioisotope are used. The\\ntotal dose of radiation absorbed is minimal, often less\\nthan the amount received from ordinary x rays. The\\nradionuclide scanner does not emit any radiation at all,\\nbut detects and records it from the patient.\\nAftercare\\nFluids are encouraged after the scan to aid in the\\nexcretion of the radioisotope. It is almost completely\\neliminated from the body within 24 hours.\\nNormal results\\nThe normal appearance of the scan will vary accord-\\ning to the patient’s age. In general, a uniform concentra-\\ntion of radionuclide uptake is present in all bones in a\\nnormal scan.\\nAbnormal results\\nA high concentration of radionuclide occurs in areas\\nof increased bone activity.

If other types of x rays are neces-\\nsary, a lead apron should be used to shield the abdominal\\nand pelvic regions.\\nDescription\\nX rays are a common diagnostic test in which a form\\nof energy called x-ray radiation penetrates the patient’s\\nbody. In bone x rays, electrical current passes through an\\nx-ray tube and produces a beam of ionizing radiation that\\npasses through the bone(s) being examined. This produces\\na picture of the inside of the body on film. The physician\\nreads the developed x ray on a wall-mounted light box.\\nDigital x rays are a new type of x ray in which con-\\nventional equipment is used to take the x ray but the\\nimage is produced via computer. In a digital x ray, the\\nimage is created on a reusable plate. After being read by\\na laser reader, the information is sent in digital form to a\\nstorage unit connected to a computer network from\\nwhich the radiologist reads the x ray. An electronic report\\ncan then be sent to the patient’s physician.\\nProblems with bones that x rays can detect result\\nfrom injury or from disease caused by a malfunction in\\nthe patient’s bone chemistry. Bone injuries, especially\\nbroken bones (fractures ), are common and can be\\naccurately diagnosed by bone x rays. X rays are espe-\\ncially helpful in diagnosing simple and incomplete frac-\\ntures which can’t be detected during a physical exami-\\nnation. X rays can also be used to check for bone posi-\\ntion in a fracture. Some bone diseases can be definitive-\\nly diagnosed with bone x rays while others require\\nadditional tests.\\nOsteoporosis, a common bone disease, can be detect-\\ned in bone x rays but other tests are then ordered to deter-\\nmine the extent of the disease. For osteomalacia and rick-\\nets, a blood test and x rays of the affected bone are usually\\ndefinitive; in some cases a bone biopsy (microscopic\\nanalysis of a small ammount of tissue) is also done. In a\\nrare bone disease called Paget’s disease, x rays may be\\nused in conjunction with bone, blood, and urine tests to\\nmake a diagnosis. In another rare bone disease, fibrous\\ndysplasia, bone x rays or a bone biopsy (microscopic\\nanalysis of a small amount of tissue) are used to confirm\\nthe diagnosis. Bone x rays are definitive in diagnosing\\nosteogenesis imperfecta. For osteomyelitis, bone x rays\\nare used in conjunction with a blood test, bone scan, or\\nneedle biopsy to make the diagnosis. For arthritis, x rays\\nof the bone are occasionally used in conjunction with\\nblood tests. In bone tumors, bone x rays are helpful but\\nthey may not be definitive.\\nBone x rays are performed by a technician or radiol-\\nogist, and interpreted by a radiologist. They are taken in\\na physician’s office, radiology unit, outpatient clinic, or\\ndiagnostic clinic. Bone x rays generally take less than 10\\nminutes. There is no pain or discomfort associated with\\nthe test, but some people find it difficult to remain still.\\nThe results are often available in minutes.\\nDuring the test, the patient lies on a table. The tech-\\nnician taking the x ray will check the patient’s position-\\ning and place the x-ray machine over the part of the body\\nbeing examined. After asking the patient to remain\\nmotionless, he or she steps out of the area and presses a\\nbutton to take the picture.\\nPreparation\\nThe patient is asked to remove clothing, jewelry, and\\nany other metal objects from the area being x rayed. If\\nappropriate, a lead shield will be placed over other body\\nparts to minimize exposure to radiation.\\nAftercare\\nThe patient can immediately resume normal activities.\\nRisks\\nThe human body contains some natural radiation\\nand is also exposed to radiation in the environment.\\nThere is a slight risk from exposure to radiation during\\nbone x rays, however, the amount of radiation is small\\nand the risk of harm is very low. If reproductive organs\\nare exposed to radiation, genetic alterations may occur.\\nExcessive or repeated doses of radiation can cause\\nchanges in other types of body tissue. No radiation\\nremains in the body after the x ray.\\nNormal results\\nNormal bones show no fractures, dislocations, or\\nother abnormalities.\\nAbnormal results\\nResults that indicate the presence of bone injury or\\ndisease differ in appearance according to the nature of the\\ninjury/disease. For example, fractures show up as clear\\nbreaks in the bones, while osteoporotic bone has the same\\nshape as a normal bone on an x ray but is less dense.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nA Manual of Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests.5th ed.

Exposure to the botulinum toxin occurs mostly\\nfrom eating contaminated food, or in infants, from cer-\\ntain clostridia growing in the intestine. Botulinum toxin\\nblocks motor nerves’ ability to release acetylcholine, the\\nneurotransmitter that relays nerve signals to muscles, and\\nflaccid paralysis occurs. As botulism progresses, the\\nmuscles that control the airway and breathing fail.\\nDescription\\nBotulism occurs rarely, but it incites concern\\nbecause of its high fatality rate. Clinical descriptions of\\nbotulism possibly reach as far back in history as ancient\\nRome and Greece. However, the relationship between\\ncontaminated food and botulism wasn’t defined until the\\nlate 1700s. In 1793 the German physician, Justinius\\nKerner, deduced that a substance in spoiled sausages,\\nwhich he called wurstgift (German for sausage poison),\\ncaused botulism. The toxin’s origin and identity\\nremained elusive until Emile von Ermengem, a Belgian\\nprofessor, isolated Clostridium botulinum in 1895 and\\nidentified it as the poison source.\\nThree types of botulism have been identified: food-\\nborne, wound, and infant botulism. The main difference\\nbetween types hinges on the route of exposure to the\\ntoxin. In the United States, there are approximately 110\\ncases of botulism reported annually. Food-borne botu-\\nlism accounts for 25% of all botulism cases and can be\\ntraced to eating contaminated home-preserved food.\\nInfant botulism accounts for 72% of all cases, but the\\nrecovery rate is good (about 98%) with proper treatment.\\nThough domestic food poisoning is a problem\\nworld-wide, there has been a growing concern regarding\\nthe use of botulism toxin in biological warfare and terror-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 559\\nBotulism\\nGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 559'),\n",

The Iraqi government admitted in 1995 that it\\nhad loaded 11,200 liters of botulinum toxin into SCUD\\nmissiles during the Gulf War. Luckily, these special mis-\\nsiles were never used. As of 1999, there were 17 coun-\\ntries known to be developing biological weapons, includ-\\ning the culture of botulism toxins.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nToxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botu-\\nlinum is the main culprit in botulism. Other members of\\nthe clostridium genus can produce botulinum toxin,\\nnamely C. argentinense, C. butyricum, and C. baratii,b u t\\nthey are minor sources. To grow, these bacteria require a\\nlow-acid, oxygen-free environment that is warm (40-\\n120°F or 4.4-48.8°C) and moist. Lacking these condi-\\ntions, the bacteria transform themselves into spores that,\\nlike plant seeds, can remain dormant for years. Clostridia\\nand their spores exist all over the world, especially in soil\\nand aquatic sediments. They do not threaten human or\\nanimal health until the spores encounter an environment\\nthat favors growth. The spores then germinate, and the\\ngrowing bacteria produce the deadly botulism toxin.\\nScientists have discovered that clostridia can produce\\nat least seven types of botulism toxin, identified as A, B,\\nC, D, E, F, and G. Humans are usually affected by A, B, E,\\nand very rarely F. Domesticated animals such as dogs, cat-\\ntle, and mink are affected by botulism C toxin, which also\\naffects birds and has caused massive die-offs in domestic\\nbird flocks and wild waterfowl. Botulism D toxin can\\ncause illness in cattle, and horses succumb to botulism A,\\nB, and C toxin. There have been no confirmed human or\\nanimal botulism cases linked to the G toxin.\\nIn humans, botulinum toxin latches onto specific\\nproteins in nerve endings and irreversibly destroys\\nthem. These proteins control the release of acetyl-\\ncholine, a neurotransmitter that stimulates muscle\\ncells. With acetylcholine release blocked, nerves are\\nnot able to stimulate muscles. Ironically, botulinum\\ntoxin has found a beneficial niche in the world of med-\\nicine due to this action. Certain medical disorders are\\ncharacterized by involuntary and uncontrollable mus-\\ncle contractions. Medical researchers have discovered\\nthat injecting a strictly controlled dose of botulinum\\ntoxin into affected muscles inhibits excessive muscle\\ncontractions. The muscle is partially paralyzed and\\nnormal movement is retained.\\nSymptoms\\nThe three types of human botulism include the fol-\\nlowing symptoms:\\n• Food-borne. Food that has been improperly preserved or\\nstored can harbor botulinum toxin-producing clostridia.\\nBotulism symptoms typically appear within 18-36 hours\\nof eating contaminated food, with extremes of four\\nhours to eight days. Initial symptoms include blurred or\\ndouble vision and difficulty swallowing and speaking.\\nPossible gastrointestinal problems include constipation,\\nnausea, and vomiting. As botulism progresses, the vic-\\ntim experiences weakness or paralysis, starting with the\\nhead muscles and progressing down the body. Breathing\\nbecomes increasingly difficult. Without medical care,\\nrespiratory failureand death are very likely.\\n• Infant. Infant botulism was first described in 1976.\\nUnlike adults, infants younger than 12 months are vul-\\nnerable to C. botulinum colonizing the intestine. Infants\\ningest spores in honey or simply by swallowing spore-\\ncontaining dust. The spores germinate in the large\\nintestine and, as the bacteria grow, they produce botu-\\nlinum toxin that is absorbed into the infant’s body. The\\nfirst symptoms include constipation, lethargy, and poor\\nfeeding. As infant botulism progresses, sucking and\\nswallowing (thus eating) become difficult. A nursing\\nmother will often notice breast engorgement as the first\\nsign of her infant’s illness. The baby suffers overall\\nweakness and cannot control head movements. Because\\nof the flaccid paralysis of the muscles, the baby appears\\n“floppy.” Breathing is impaired, and death from respira-\\ntory failure is a very real danger.\\n• Wound. Confirmed cases of wound botulism have been\\nlinked to trauma such as severe crush injuries to the\\nextremities, surgery, and illegal drug use. Wound botu-\\nlism occurs when clostridia colonize an infected wound\\nand produce botulinum toxin. The symptoms usually\\nappear four to 18 days after an injury occurs and are\\nsimilar to food-borne botulism, although gastrointesti-\\nnal symptoms may be absent.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of botulism can be tricky because symp-\\ntoms mimic those presented by other diseases. Botulism\\nmay be confused with Guillain-Barre syndrome,myas-\\nthenia gravis, drug reactions, stroke, or nervous system\\ninfection, intoxications (e.g. carbon monoxide or\\natropine), or shellfish poisoning. Sepsis is the most com-\\nmon initial diagnosis for infant botulism. Failure to\\nthrive may also be suspected. Some reports have linked\\ninfant botulism to 5-15% of sudden infant death syn-\\ndrome (SIDS, crib death) cases. Laboratory tests are\\nused for definitive diagnosis, but if botulism seems like-\\nly, treatment starts immediately.\\nWhile waiting for laboratory results, doctors ask\\nabout recently consumed food and work to dismiss other\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2560\\nBotulism\\nGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 560'),\n",

Bowel preparation is a\\ncleansing of the intestines from fecal matter and secretions.\\nPurpose\\nThe ultimate goal of bowel preparation is priming the\\nbowel for a diagnosis procedure (using x rays to detect a\\ndisease process in the intestines) or for surgical interven-\\ntion (such as removal of polyps,cancer, or narrowing of\\nthe intestinal diameter). Colonoscopy is an effective\\ntreatment procedure for polyps (a growing mass of tis-\\nsue). This procedure enables visualization of the entire\\nlarge bowel. During a colonoscopy, polyps can be cauter-\\nized (applying an electric current which incinerates the\\npolyp). The procedure can be both diagnostic and thera-\\npeutic. A sigmoidoscopy scope is a flexible tube that\\nallows clinicians to view the sigmoid colon (the part of\\nthe large intestine before the rectum). This procedure is\\nimportant for detection of colon/rectal cancer. It is safe,\\nquick to perform (usually 30–45 minutes in about 90% of\\ncases), and an effective diagnostic tool for evaluation of:\\n• rectal bleeding\\n• other studies that showed an abnormality\\n• removal of polyps\\n• biopsy\\n• evaluation of chronic diarrhea or inflammatory bowel\\ndisease\\n• to detect recurrences for colon/rectal cancer or polyps\\n• relieving a twisted bowel\\n• foreign body removal\\n• treating bleeding lesions\\n• preventive surveillance of cancer in patients with a pos-\\nitive family history of colon cancer\\nPrecautions\\nAntibiotic prophylaxis is not routinely recommend-\\ned.

Wright, RN\\nBowel surgery with ostomy see Colostomy\\nBowel training\\nDefinition\\nBowel training helps to reestablish normal bowel\\nmovements in persons who suffer from constipation ,\\ndiarrhea , incontinence, or irregularity. Healthy bowel\\nactivity is considered one or two movements of moderate\\nsize every day.\\nPurpose\\nMany people for many reasons have irregular bowel\\nfunction. In some cases, the irregularity lasts beyond the\\ncondition that caused it. The bowels by themselves develop\\nbad habits that can be retrained with suitable exercises and\\neducation. Normal bowel habits not only improve the qual-\\nity of life, they help prevent several common diseases—for\\nexample, diverticulitis and fecal impaction. Gall stones,\\nappendicitis, colon cancer, hiatal hernia, diabetes, and\\nheart disease have also been related to the quality of bowel\\nmovements and the foods that affect them.\\n• One of the most common causes of constipation is the\\nlaxative habit. Repeated artificial stimulation of the\\nbowels destroys their natural emptying reflex, so that\\nthey will no longer move without artificial stimulants.\\nThe laxative habit begins innocently enough with the\\ncorrect belief that bowels should move every day, how-\\never,laxatives will cause the evacuation of several days\\nworth of stool in a single movement. Impatient for stool\\nto reaccumulate for the necessary few days, the patient\\ntakes another laxative, and the cycle begins.\\n• The other major cause of constipation is a diet with\\ninsufficient bulk or roughage. The bowel works more\\nsmoothly the more contents it has. Western diets of\\nhighly refined foods have eliminated most of the residue\\nfrom food. The result is that most food is absorbed, leav-\\ning little to pass through and be excreted as feces.\\n• Constipation occurs acutely with impaction—the pres-\\nence in the rectum of a mass of feces too large to pass.\\nFecal impaction is usually the result of poor bowel\\nhabits, a diet with too little liquid and roughage, and\\ninadequate physical activity.\\n• Diarrhea, whether acute or chronic, can disrupt the\\nbowel’s normal rhythm and lead to irregularity.\\n• Several diseases of the nervous system affect bowel\\nreflexes.\\nDescription\\nBowel training reestablishes the bowel’s normal\\nreflexes by repeating a routine until it becomes a habit.\\nNaturally the patient must be able and willing to cooper-\\nate. Some patients are so convinced they need daily laxa-\\ntives that they are afraid to do without them. It takes time\\nfor a changed diet to effect the bowels and for the bowel to\\nregain its normal rhythm. Trust and patience are necessary.\\nAfter gaining the patient’s cooperation, the next step\\nis to optimize the diet. Healthy bowel movements require\\ningestion of a large amount of liquids and bulk foods.\\nThe patient should drink two to three quarts of liquids\\nevery day, with liberal inclusion of prune juice and per-\\nhaps coffee for their natural laxative effect. Bulk comes\\nfrom unrefined foods. Oat bran, wheat bran, brown rice,\\ngreen vegetables, apples, and pears are a few examples of\\nhigh residue foods. Many patients will benefit from\\nadding bulk preparations of psyllium. Constipating foods\\nlike bananas and cheese should be avoided until a natural\\nrhythm is well established.\\nTo assure that stools are soft enough to pass easily, it\\nis a good idea to add a pure stool softener like DOSS\\n(dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate), two to four per day as\\nneeded. DOSS also helps prevent impaction.\\nThere is usually a time of day when bowel move-\\nments are more likely to occur.

Under certain circumstances, however, bacteria\\ncan invade the brain and cause a localized infection\\ncalled an abscess. Brain abscess is relatively rare,\\naccounting for 1 in 10,000 hospital admissions. Single\\nabscess occurs in 75% of cases, and the remainder of\\ncases involve multiple abscesses. If not treated, brain\\nabscess is almost always fatal.\\nKEY TERMS\\nDefecate—To pass feces (stool) out of the rectum\\nthrough the anus.\\nDiverticulitis —Infection of outpouchings in the\\nlarge bowel.\\nFecal impaction —Obstruction of the rectum by a\\nlarge mass of feces (stool).\\nHiatal hernia —Part of the stomach displaced\\nthrough the diaphragm into the chest.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nOne-half of all brain abscesses are caused by the\\nspread of bacteria from a nearby infection. Sources of\\nbacteria include:\\n• middle ear infections (otitis media) or infections in the\\nbony spaces in front of the middle ear (mastoiditis)\\n• sinus infections\\n• an abscessed tooth.\\nOther sources of bacteria include:\\n• lung infections\\n• abdominal infection\\n• infection of the heart’s lining (endocarditis)\\n• penetrating head wounds\\n• neurosurgery\\nAcquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ( AIDS) or\\nthe presence of another immune deficiency greatly\\nincreases the risk of brain abscess. Approximately 25%\\nof cases have no detectable cause of infection.\\nBrain abscess can be caused by a variety of organ-\\nisms, many of them related to ear and sinus infections.\\nMany times brain abscess cases are caused by two or\\nmore bacteria. In 30–60% of cases, the bacteria combina-\\ntion includes streptococci, microorganisms that can live\\nwithout oxygen (anaerobes), and enterobacteria. A small\\nnumber of cases are caused by yeast, fungi, and single-\\ncell organisms (protozoa).\\nThe symptoms of brain abscess often develop slow-\\nly, usually within a period of about two weeks. The most\\ncommon symptoms are:\\n• headache\\n• neurologic symptoms related to the specific part of the\\nbrain that is infected\\n• altered mental status\\n• seizures\\nFever and stiff neck occur in less than one-third of\\ncases. Additional symptoms may include vomiting, eye\\ntremor (nystagmus ), poor balance, and uncoordinated\\nmovements.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of brain abscess is performed by using a\\ncomputed tomography scan (CT) or a magnetic reso-\\nnance imaging (MRI) scan to determine the site of\\ninfection. Tissue removal (biopsy) is usually performed\\nas well. A biopsy is performed to determine the type of\\nbacterium involved.

These tests include blood cultures, x rays\\nof the chest, and a physical exam of the ears, sinuses, and\\nteeth. A test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\\nis usually also performed.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment for brain abscess begins with intravenous\\nantibiotics , chosen to match the infecting bacterium if\\nknown, or to cover a wide spectrum of possibilities if not.\\nTreatment usually continues for six to eight weeks.\\nAspiration surgery is almost always done to drain the\\nabscess. In this procedure, a needle is guided to the infect-\\ned site by CT scan, and fluid is removed (aspirated) from\\nthe abscess. Aspiration may be repeated several times\\nuntil the bacteria are completely killed or removed. Surgi-\\ncal removal of infected or dead tissue may be needed in\\nsome cases. For patients with many sites of infection,\\naspiration or surgical removal is not done because of the\\nincreased difficulty and risk of the procedure. For these\\npatients, antibiotic therapy alone is used. Steroid treat-\\nment is controversial, but may be indicated in some cases.\\nPrognosis\\nEven with prompt treatment, brain abscess is fatal in\\nabout 20% of cases. About half of those who survive\\nhave some residual neurological problems, including\\nseizures in many patients.\\nThere are several reasons why patients with brain\\nabscess can have a poor prognosis. The illness may not\\nbe diagnosed correctly or an accurate diagnosis may take\\nadditional time. The patient may receive an antibiotic\\nthat does not match the infecting organism. Sometimes\\nthe infection may not be limited to a definite area in the\\nbrain, making diagnosis and treatment difficult. The\\nsmall number of cases caused by fungal infection may\\ntake additional time to diagnose. A patient may also have\\na poor prognosis because there is more than one abscess,\\nthe location of the abscess may be deep within the brain,\\nor the infection may have moved into many locations\\nwithin the brain. Severe complications can result from\\nbrain abscess, including comma and brain rupture. In 80-\\n100% of cases involving brain rupture, the patient dies.\\nPrevention\\nBrain abscess may be preventable by prompt and\\naggressive treatment of the infections which give rise to\\nit, especially sinus and ear infections.\\nKEY TERMS\\nBiopsy—The removal of a tissue sample for exami-\\nnation.\\nAspiration—Removal of fluid from a closed space\\nthrough a needle.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nHarrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine.Ed.

A brain tumor is considered\\nmalignant if it contains cancer cells, or if it is composed\\nof harmless cells located in an area where it suppresses\\none or more vital functions.\\nDescription\\nEach year, more than 17,000 brain tumors are diag-\\nnosed in the United States. About half of all primary\\nbrain tumors are benign, but in life-threatening locations.\\nThe rest are malignant and invasive.\\nBenign brain tumors\\nBenign brain tumors, composed of harmless cells,\\nhave clearly defined borders, can usually be completely\\nremoved, and are unlikely to recur.

It is highly unusu-\\nal for malignant brain tumors to spread beyond the cen-\\ntral nervous system (CNS).\\nPrimary brain tumors\\nPrimary brain tumors originate in the brain. They\\nrepresent about 1% of all cancers and 2.5% of all cancer\\ndeaths.\\nMetastatic or secondary brain tumors\\nApproximately 25% of all cancer patients develop\\nsecondary or metastatic brain tumors when cancer cells\\nspread from another part of the body to the brain. Sec-\\nondary brain tumors are most apt to occur in patients\\nwho have:\\n• breast cancer.\\n• colon cancer.\\n• kidney cancer.\\n• lung cancer.\\n• melanoma (cancer) of the skin. These metastatic brain\\ntumors can develop on any part of the brain or spinal\\ncord.\\n• cancer within the nasal passages and/or throat that fol-\\nlow the nerve pathways into the skull, and metastasize\\nto the brain.\\nWho gets brain tumors\\nBrain tumors can develop at any age, but are most\\ncommon in children between the ages of 3-12, and in\\nadults aged 55-65. Primary brain cancer is the second\\nmost common cause of cancer death between birth and\\nthe age of 34, and the fourth most common cause of can-\\ncer death in men aged 35-54. Primary tumors of the brain\\nand central nervous system are often associated with HIV\\ninfection. Men and caucasians have a higher risk of devel-\\noping brain tumors. Other risk factors being studied\\ninclude children with a history of previous radiation treat-\\nment to the head for cancer; parents with certain cancers\\n(nervous system, salivary gland, colon); having an older\\nfather; having well-educated parents; occupational expo-\\nsure to vinyl chloride, lead, and pesticides; history of\\nepilepsy; history of certain genetic conditions (tuberous\\nsclerosis,neurofibromatosis, von Hippel Lindau, famil-\\nial polyposis, Osler-Weber-Rendu, Li-Fraumeni).\\nNaming and grading brain tumors\\nThe name of a brain tumor describes where it origi-\\nnates, how it grows, and what kind of cells it contains. A\\ntumor in an adult is also graded or staged according to:\\n• how malignant it is\\n• how rapidly it is growing and how likely it is to invade\\nother tissues\\n• how closely its cells resemble normal cells. (The more\\nabnormal a tumor cell looks, the faster it is likely to\\ngrow)\\nLow-grade brain tumors usually have well-defined\\nborders. Some low-grade brain tumors form or are\\nenclosed (encapsulated) in cysts. Low-grade brain\\ntumors grow slowly, if at all. They may spread through-\\nout the brain, but rarely metastasize to other parts of the\\nbody.\\nMid-grade and high-grade tumors grow more rapid-\\nly than low-grade tumors. Described as “truly malig-\\nnant,” these tumors usually infiltrate healthy tissue. The\\ngrowth pattern makes it difficult to remove the entire\\ntumor, and these tumors recur more often than low-grade\\ntumors.\\nA single brain tumor can contain several different\\ntypes of cells. The tumor’s grade is determined by the\\nhighest-grade (most malignant) cell detected under a\\nmicroscope, even if most of the cells in the tumor are less\\nmalignant. An infiltrating tumor is a tumor of any grade\\nthat grows into surrounding tissue.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 569\\nBrain tumor\\nGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 569'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 583}, page_content='Types of brain tumors\\nGlioma is the term used to refer to the most preva-\\nlent primary brain tumors. Gliomas arise from glial tis-\\nsue, which supports and nourishes cells that send mes-\\nsages from the brain to other parts of the body. These\\ntumors may be either malignant or benign. Astrocy-\\ntomas, ependymomas, and mixed gliomas are three of\\nthe most common gliomas.\\nASTROCYTOMAS. Named for the star-like shape of\\ntheir cells, astrocytomas can develop on any part of the\\nbrain or spinal cord. Non-infiltrating astrocytomas grow\\nslowly, and rarely spread to nearby tissue. Mild-to-mod-\\nerately anaplastic astrocytomas with well-differentiated\\nborders do not grow as slowly as non-infiltrating astrocy-\\ntomas, and they do spread to surrounding tissues.\\nAnaplastic astrocytomas, which are also called\\nGrade III astrocytomas, look more abnormal and grow\\nmore rapidly than non-infiltrating or mild-to-moderately\\nanaplastic tumors.\\nGrade IV astrocytomas are also called glioblastoma\\nmultiforme (GBM) tumors. Accounting for 30% of all\\nprimary brain tumors, GBMs are the most common brain\\ntumors in middle-aged adults. GBMs are the most malig-\\nnant of all brain tumors. Because they contain a greater\\nmixture of cells than any other brain tumor, they are the\\nmost difficult to treat.\\nEPENDYMOMAS. Also called ependymal tumors,\\nependymomas account for 9% of all gliomas, and 5% of\\nall intracranial tumors. These tumors, which are most\\ncommon in children and adolescents, begin in the very\\nthin membranes that help form cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)\\nand line the brain cavities (ventricles) that contain it.\\nEpendymomas are usually benign, have well-differ-\\nentiated borders, resemble normal cells, and grow very\\nslowly. The cells of anaplastic (malignant) ependymo-\\nmas look abnormal and grow more rapidly than the cells\\nof benign tumors.\\nMIXED GLIOMAS. These heterogeneous tumors con-\\ntain elements of astrocytomas and ependymomas and/or\\noligodendrogliomas. These are rare tumors that usually\\noccur in middle-aged adults, grow slowly, and do not\\nusually spread beyond the part of the brain where they\\noriginate. Mixed gliomas behave like tumors composed\\nof the highest-grade cells they contain.\\nNon-glial brain tumors\\nThe most common brain tumors that do not develop\\nfrom glial cells are medulloblastomas, meningiomas, and\\nSchwannomas.\\nMEDULLOBLASTOMAS. Scientists once thought\\nmedulloblastomas (MDLs) developed from glial cells.\\nThese fast-growing, malignant tumors are now believed\\nto originate in developing cells not normally present in\\nthe body after birth. They are sometimes called primitive\\nneurodectal tumors (PNET).\\nMDL tumors are most common in children and are\\nmore common in boys than in girls. Only 30% of MDL\\ntumors occur in adults. MDL tumors usually originate\\nin the cerebellum (the part of the brain that controls\\ncoordination and some muscle activity), and are often\\ncarried to other parts of the brain by cerebrospinal fluid.\\nMDL tumors rarely metastasize beyond the brain and\\nspinal cord.\\nMENINGIOMAS. Meningiomas, which represent\\nmore than 20% of all primary brain tumors, originate in\\nthe membranes that enclose the brain and spinal cord\\n(meninges). These tumors are usually benign and most\\noften occur in women aged 30-50 years old. Menin-\\ngiomas grow so slowly that the brain can sometimes\\nbecome accustomed to their presence. Meningiomas\\ncompress, rather than invade, brain tissue and may grow\\nto be quite large before any symptoms appear.\\nSCHWANNOMAS. Schwannomas originate in the\\nSchwann cells. These cells produce myelin, material that\\nprotects the acoustic nerve, which controls hearing.\\nThese benign tumors are twice as common in women as\\nin men, and are most often diagnosed in patients between\\nthe ages 30-60.\\nSchwannomas grow very slowly, and many people\\nadapt to the slight hearing loss and balance problems\\nthat are the tumors’ earliest symptoms. A pear-shaped\\nSchwannoma can cause sudden or gradual loss of hear-\\ning in an ear. As the tumor progresses, it can press on the\\nnerves that control movement and feeling in the face, and\\ncause headaches and facial numbness or tingling. The\\npatient may have trouble walking, swallowing, or con-\\ntrolling eye movements, and the sense of taste can be\\naffected. A Schwannoma that grows large enough to\\npress on the brainstem can be deadly.\\nCHILDHOOD BRAIN TUMORS. Brain tumors that\\noccur in children are described as supratentorial (in the\\nupper part of the brain) or infratentorial (in the lowest\\npart of the brain). Astrocytomas and ependymomas are\\ncommon supratentorial tumors. Infratentorial tumors\\ninclude medulloblastomas, astrocytomas, and ependy-\\nmomas.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe cause of primary brain tumors is unknown, but\\npeople who work with rubber and certain chemicals have\\na greater-than-average risk of developing them.

Implant radiation therapyinvolves placing tiny\\npieces of radioactive material in the brain.

This can be accomplished surgi-\\ncally, or by withdrawing tissue through a needle.\\nPurpose\\nA biopsy is recommended when a significant\\nabnormality is found, either on physical examination\\nand/or by an imaging test. Examples of abnormality can\\ninclude a breast lump felt during physical self examina-\\ntion or tissue changes noticed from a mammogram test.\\nBefore a biopsy is performed, it is important to make\\nsure that the threat of cancer cannot be disproved or\\nruled out by a simpler, less invasive examination. A\\nlump may be obviously harmless when examined by\\nultrasound. If this is not decisive, the presence of cancer\\nor a variety of benign breast conditions can be deter-\\nmined using a biopsy.\\nPrecautions\\nThe type of biopsy recommended should be consid-\\nered. This will depend on whether the area can be felt,\\nhow well it can be seen on mammogram or ultrasound,\\nand how suspicious it feels or appears. Specialized\\nequipment is needed for different types of biopsy and\\navailability may vary. Generally, needle biopsy is less\\ninvasive than surgical biopsy. It is appropriate for most,\\nbut not all situations. However, some surgeons feel it is\\nfar less accurate.\\nDescription\\nSurgical biopsy\\nIf an abnormality is not felt during a self examina-\\ntion, there are signs that indicate the need for medical\\nattention. These include:\\n• severe breast pain\\n• changes in the size of a breast or the nipple\\n• changes in the shape of both breast or nipple\\n• pitting, dumpling or redness of the breast skin\\n• nipple redness, irritation, or inversion\\n• changes in the pattern of veins visible on the surface of\\nthe breast\\n• some types of nipple discharge\\nIf the abnormality is not felt, a needle localization\\nmust be done before the actual surgery. After local anes-\\nthetic is administered, a fine wire is placed in the area of\\nconcern. Either x ray or ultrasound guidance is used. The\\npatient is awake and usually sitting up.\\nThere are two types of breast biopsy considered\\nhere, excisional and incisional. An excisional biopsy is a\\nsurgical procedure, where the entire area of concern and\\nsome surrounding tissue is removed. It is usually done as\\nan outpatient procedure, in a hospital or free standing\\nsurgery center. The patient may be awake, and is some-\\ntimes given medication to make her drowsy. The area to\\nbe operated on is numbed with local anesthetic. Infre-\\nquently, general anesthesia is used.\\nAn excisional biopsy itself usually takes under one\\nhour. The total amount of time spent at the facility\\ndepends on the type of anesthesia used, whether a needle\\nlocalization was done, and the extent of the surgery.\\nIf a mass is very large, an incisional biopsy may be\\nperformed. In this case only a portion of the area is\\nremoved and sent for analysis. The procedure is the same\\nas an excisional biopsy in other respects.\\nNeedle biopsy\\nA needle biopsy removes part of the suspicious area\\nfor examination. There are two types, aspiration biopsy\\n(using a fine needle), and large core needle biopsy. Either\\nof these may be called a percutaneous needle biopsy. Per-\\ncutaneous refers to a procedure done through the skin.\\nA fine needle aspiration biopsy uses a very thin nee-\\ndle to withdraw fluid and cells that can be studied. It can\\nbe done in a doctor’s office, clinic, or hospital. Local\\nanesthetic may be used, but is sometimes withheld, as it\\nmay be more painful than the biopsy needle. The area to\\nplace the needle may be located by touch. No specialized\\nequipment is needed. However, using ultrasound guid-\\nance enables the physician to feel and see the lesion at\\nthe same time. The actual withdrawing of fluid and cells\\ncan be visualized as it occurs. This helps ensure that the\\nspecimen is taken from the right place.\\nA large core needle biopsy uses a larger diameter\\nneedle to remove small pieces of tissue, about the size of\\na grain of rice. It can be done in a clinic or hospital that\\nhas the appropriate facilities.

Ultrasound or x ray is used for guidance of a\\nlarge core needle biopsy.\\nIf the suspicious area is seen best with x ray, a stereo-\\ntactic device is used. This means that x rays are taken from\\nseveral angles. This information is fed into a computer,\\nwhich analyzes the data and guides the needle to the correct\\nplace. The patient may be sitting up, or she may be lying on\\nher stomach, with her breast positioned through an opening\\nin the table. The breast is held firmly, but comfortably\\nbetween a plastic paddle and a metal plate, similar to those\\nused for mammograms (a set of x rays taken of the front\\nand side of the breast). X rays may be taken before, during,\\nand after the tissue is drawn into the needle, to confirm that\\nthe correct spot is biopsied. This procedure may also be\\nreferred to as a stereotactic core biopsy, or a mammotomy.\\nUltrasound is used to guide needle placement for\\nsome lesions. The patient lies on her back or side. After the\\narea is numbed, sterile gel is applied. The physician places\\na transducer, an instrument about the size of an electric\\nshaver, over the skin. This produces an image from the\\nreflection of sound waves. A special needle, usually in a\\nspring loaded device, is used to obtain the tissue. The pro-\\ncedure is observed on a monitor as it is happening.\\nPreparation\\nA surgical breast biopsy may require the patient to\\nhave nothing to eat or drink for a period of time before\\nthe operation. This will typically be from midnight the\\nnight before, if general anesthesia is planned. No food\\nrestrictions are necessary for needle biopsy. It is advis-\\nable to eat lightly before the procedure. This is especially\\nimportant if the patient will be lying on her stomach for a\\nstereotactic biopsy.\\nAftercare\\nAfter a surgical biopsy, the incision will be closed\\nwith stitches, and covered with a bandage. The bandage\\ncan usually be removed in one or two days. Stitches are\\ntaken out approximately one week afterward. Depending\\non the extent of the operation, normal activities can be\\nresumed in approximately one to three days. Vigorous\\nexercisemay be limited for one to three weeks.\\nThe skin opening for a needle biopsy is minimal. It\\nmay be closed with thin, clear tape, called a steri strip, or\\ncovered with a bandaid and a small gauze bandage. The\\npatient can return to her usual routine immediately after\\nthe biopsy. Strenuous activity or heavy lifting is not rec-\\nommended for 24 hours. Any bandages can be removed\\none or two days after the biopsy.\\nRisks\\nInfection is always a possibility when the skin is\\nbroken, although this rarely occurs.

This is a collection of blood at the\\nbiopsy site. It is usually absorbed naturally by the body.\\nIf it is very large and uncomfortable, it may need to be\\ndrained.

Sometimes this may make future\\nmammograms harder to interpret accurately.\\nA false negative pathology report is another risk.\\nThis means that no cancer was found when a cancer was\\npresent.

The malignant cells origi-\\nnate in the lining of the milk glands or ducts of the breast\\n(ductal epithelium), defining this malignancy as a cancer.\\nCancer cells are characterized by uncontrolled division\\nleading to abnormal growth and the ability of these cells\\nto invade normal tissue locally or to spread throughout\\nthe body, in a process called metastasis.\\nDescription\\nBreast cancer arises in the milk-producing glands of\\nthe breast tissue. Groups of glands in normal breast tis-\\nsue are called lobules. The products of these glands are\\nsecreted into a ductal system that leads to the nipple.\\nDepending on where in the glandular or ductal unit of the\\nbreast the cancer arises, it will develop certain character-\\nistics that are used to sub-classify breast cancer into\\ntypes.

The stage before invasive cancer is called in situ,\\nmeaning that the early malignancy has not yet become\\ncapable of invasion. Thus, ductal carcinoma in situ is\\nconsidered a minimal breast cancer.\\nHow breast cancer spreads\\nThe primary tumor begins in the breast itself but once\\nit becomes invasive, it may progress beyond the breast to\\nthe regional lymph nodes or travel (metastasize) to other\\norgan systems in the body and become systemic in nature.\\nLymph is the clear, protein-rich fluid that bathes the cells\\nthroughout the body. Lymph will work its way back to the\\nbloodstream via small channels known as lymphatics.\\nAlong the way, the lymph is filtered through cellular sta-\\ntions known as nodes, thus they are called lymph nodes.\\nNearly all organs in the body have a primary lymph node\\ngroup filtering the tissue fluid, or lymph, that comes from\\nthat organ. In the breast, the primary lymph nodes are\\nunder the armpit, or axilla. Classically, the primary tumor\\nbegins in the breast and the first place to which it is likely\\nto spread is the regional lymph nodes. Cancer, as it\\ninvades in its place of origin, may also work its way into\\nblood vessels. If cancer gets into the blood vessels, the\\nblood vessels provide yet another route for the cancer to\\nspread to other organs of the body.\\nBreast cancer follows this classic progression though\\nit often becomes systemic or widespread early in the\\ncourse of the disease. By the time one can feel a lump in\\nthe breast it is often 0.4 inches, or one centimeter, in size\\nand contains roughly a million cells. It is estimated that a\\ntumor of this size may take one to five years to develop.\\nDuring that time, the cancer may metastasize, or spread\\nby lymphatics or blood to areas elsewhere in the body.\\nWhen primary breast cancer spreads, it may first go\\nto the regional lymph nodes under the armpit, the axil-\\nlary nodes. If this occurs, regional metastasis exists. If it\\nproceeds elsewhere either by lymphatic or blood-borne\\nspread, the patient develops systemic metastasis that may\\ninvolve a number of other organs in the body. Favorite\\nsites of systemic involvement for breast cancer are the\\nlung, bones, liver, and the skin and soft tissue. As it turns\\nout, the presence of, and the actual number of, regional\\nlymph nodes containing cancer remains the single best\\nindicator of whether or not the cancer has become widely\\nmetastatic. Because tests to discover metastasis in other\\norgans may not be sensitive enough to reveal minute\\ndeposits, the evaluation of the axilla for regional metasta-\\nsis becomes very important in making treatment deci-\\nsions for this disease.\\nIf breast cancer spreads to other major organs of the\\nbody, its presence will compromise the function of those\\norgans. Death is the result of extreme compromise of\\nvital organ function.\\nDemographics\\nEvery woman is at risk for breast cancer. If she lives\\nto be 85, there is a one out of nine chance that she will\\ndevelop the condition sometime during her life. As a\\nwoman ages, her risk of developing breast cancer rises\\ndramatically regardless of her family history. The breast\\ncancer risk of a 25-year-old woman is only one out of\\n19,608; by age 45, it is one in 93. In fact, less than 5% of\\ncases are discovered before age 35 and the majority of all\\nbreast cancers are found in women over age 50.\\nIn 1999, there were 180,000 new cases of breast can-\\ncer diagnosed. About 45,000 women die of breast cancer\\neach year, accounting for 16% of deaths caused by cancer\\nin women. For the first time ever, mortality rates decreased\\nan average of 1.7% per year from 1995 through 1999, a\\nreflection of earlier diagnosis and improving therapies.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThere are a number of risk factors for the develop-\\nment of breast cancer, including:\\n• family history of breast cancer in mother or sister\\n• early onset of menstruation and late menopause\\n• reproductive history: women who had no children or\\nhave children after age 30 and women who have never\\nbreastfed have increased risk\\n• history of abnormal breast biopsies\\nThough these are recognized risk factors, it is impor-\\ntant to note that more than 70% of women who get breast\\ncancer have no known risk factors. Having several risk\\nfactors may boost a woman’s chances of developing\\nbreast cancer, but the interplay of predisposing factors is\\ncomplex. In addition to those accepted factors listed\\nabove, some studies suggest that high-fat diets, obesity,\\nor the use of alcohol may contribute to the risk profile.\\nAnother factor that may contribute to a woman’s risk\\nprofile is hormone replacement therapy (HRT).\\nHRT provides significant relief of menopausal\\nsymptoms, prevention of osteoporosis, and possibly pro-\\ntection from cardiovascular disease and stroke. Howev-\\ner, studies show that there is a small increased risk of\\ndeveloping breast cancer with HRT use. Thus, the use of\\nhormone replacement therapy should be based on per-\\nsonal risk factors.\\nOf all the risk factors listed above, family history is\\nthe most important.

However, breast cancer due to\\nheredity is only a small proportion of breast cancer cases;\\nonly 5%–10% of all breast cancer cases will be women\\nwho inherited a susceptibility through their genes. Nev-\\nertheless, when the family history is strong for develop-\\nment of breast cancer, a woman’s risk is increased.\\nNot all lumps detected in the breast are cancerous.\\nFibrocystic changes in the breast are extremely common.\\nAlso known as fibrocystic condition of the breast, fibro-\\ncystic changes are a leading cause of non-cancerous lumps\\nin the breast. Fibrocystic changes also cause symptoms of\\npain, swelling, or discharge and may become evident to\\nthe patient or physician as a lump that is either solid or\\nfilled with fluid. Complete diagnostic evaluation of any\\nsignificant breast abnormality is mandatory because\\nthough women commonly develop fibrocystic changes,\\nbreast cancer is common also, and the signs and symptoms\\nof fibrocystic changes overlap with those of breast cancer.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of breast cancer is accomplished by the\\nbiopsy of any suspicious lump or mammographic abnor-\\nmality that has been identified. (A biopsy is the removal of\\ntissue for examination by a pathologist. A mammogram is\\na low-dose, 2-view, x-ray examination of the breast.) The\\npatient may be prompted to visit her doctor upon finding a\\nlump in a breast, or she may have noticed skin dimpling,\\nnipple retraction, or discharge from the nipple. Or, the\\npatient may not have noticed anything abnormal, and a\\nlump is detected by the mammogram.\\nWhen a patient has no signs or symptoms\\nScreening involves the evaluation of women who\\nhave no symptoms or signs of a breast problem, so when\\nthe screening mammogram leads to the evaluation, the\\npatient has no symptoms and may not have any abnor-\\nmality on examination of the breast. Mammography has\\nbeen very helpful in detecting breast cancer that one can-\\nnot identify on physical examination . However,\\n10%–13% of breast cancer does not show up on mam-\\nmography, and a similar number of patients with breast\\ncancer have an abnormal mammogram and a normal\\nphysical examination. These figures emphasize the need\\nfor examination as part of the screening process.\\nScreening\\nIt is recommended that women get into the habit of\\ndoing monthly breast self examinations to detect any\\nlump at an early stage. If an uncertainty or a lump is\\nfound, evaluation by an experienced physician and mam-\\nmography is recommended. The American Cancer Soci-\\nety (ACS) has made recommendations for the use of\\nmammography on a screening basis. There has been con-\\ntroversy about the timing and appropriate frequency of\\nmammography when used as a screening tool, but the\\nACS recommendations are as follows: Women should\\nget annual mammograms after age 40. Those with a sig-\\nnificant family history (one or more first-degree relatives\\nwho have been treated for breast cancer), should start\\nannual mammograms 10 years younger than the\\nyoungest relative was when she was diagnosed, but not\\nearlier than 35.\\nBecause of the greater awareness of breast cancer in\\nrecent years, screening evaluations by examinations and\\nmammography are performed much more frequently than\\nin the past. The result is that the number of breast cancers\\ndiagnosed increased, but the disease is being diagnosed at\\nan earlier stage than previously.

In a fine needle\\naspiration biopsy, a fine-gauge needle may be passed into\\nthe lesion and cells from the area suctioned into the nee-\\ndle can be quickly prepared for microscopic evaluation\\n(cytology). (The patient experiencing nipple discharge\\ncan have a sample taken of the discharge for cytological\\nevaluation, also.) Fine needle aspiration is a simple pro-\\ncedure that can be done under local anesthesia, and will\\ntell if the lesion is a fluid-filled cyst or whether it is solid.\\nThe sample obtained will yield much diagnostic informa-\\ntion. Fine needle aspiration biopsy is an excellent tech-\\nnique when the lump is palpable and the physician can\\neasily hit the target with the needle. If the lesion is a sim-\\nple cyst, the fluid will be evacuated and the mass will\\ndisappear. If it is solid, the diagnosis may be obtained.\\nCare must be taken, however, because if the mass is solid\\nand the specimen is non-malignant, a complete removal\\nof the lesion may be appropriate to be sure.\\nCORE NEEDLE BIOPSY. Core needle biopsies are also\\nobtained simply under local anesthesia. The larger piece\\nof tissue obtained with its preserved architecture may be\\nhelpful in confirming the diagnosis short of open surgical\\nremoval. An open surgical incisional biopsy is rarely\\nneeded for diagnosis because of the needle techniques. If\\nthere remains question as to diagnosis, a complete open\\nsurgical biopsy may be required.\\nEXCISIONAL BIOPSY. When performed, the excision-\\nal, (complete removal) biopsy is a minimal outpatient\\nprocedure often done under local anesthesia.\\nNON-PALPABLE LESIONS. As screening increases,\\nnon-palpable lesions demonstrated only by mammogra-\\nphy are becoming more common. The use of x rays and\\ncomputers to guide the needle for biopsy or to place\\nmarkers for the surgeon performing the excisional biopsy\\nare commonly employed. Some benign lesions can be\\nfully removed by multiple directed core biopsies. These\\ntechniques are very appealing because they are minimal-\\nly invasive; however, the physician needs to be careful to\\nobtain a good sample.\\nOther tests\\nIf a lesion is not palpable and has simple cystic char-\\nacteristics on mammography, ultrasound may be utilized\\nboth to determine that it is a cyst and to guide its evacua-\\ntion. Ultrasound may also be used in some cases to guide\\nfine needle or core biopsies of the breast.\\nComputed tomography (CT scan, CAT scans), and\\nmagnetic resonance imaging , (MRI), have only a very\\noccasional use in the evaluation of breast lesions.\\nTreatment\\nStaging\\nOnce diagnosis is established, before treatment is\\nrendered, more tests are done to determine if the cancer\\nhas spread beyond the breast. These tests include a chest\\nx ray and blood count with liver function tests . Along\\nwith the liver function measured by the blood sample, the\\nlevel of alkaline phosphatase, an enzyme from bone, is\\nalso determined. A radionuclear bone scan may be\\nordered. This test looks at the places in the body to which\\nbreast cancer usually metastasizes. A CT scan may also\\nbe ordered. The physician will do a careful examination\\nof the axilla to assess likelihood of regional metastasis\\nbut unfortunately this exam is not very accurate.

This helps define treatment proto-\\ncol and prognosis. After surgical treatment, the final, or\\npathologic, stage is defined as the true axillary lymph\\nnode status is known. Detailed staging criteria are avail-\\nable from the American Joint Commission on Cancer\\nManual and are generalized here:\\n• Stage 1—The cancer is no larger than 2 cm (0.8 in) and\\nno cancer cells are found in the lymph nodes.\\n• Stage 2—The cancer is between 2 cm and 5 cm, and the\\ncancer has spread to the lymph nodes.\\n• Stage 3A—Tumor is larger than 5 cm (2 in) or is small-\\ner than 5 cm, but has spread to the lymph nodes, which\\nhave grown into each other.\\n• Stage 3B—Cancer has spread to tissues near the breast,\\n(local invasion), or to lymph nodes inside the chest\\nwall, along the breastbone.\\n• Stage 4—Cancer has spread to skin and lymph nodes\\nbeyond the axilla or to other organs of the body.\\nTreatment\\nSurgery, radiation, and chemotherapy are all uti-\\nlized in the treatment of breast cancer. Depending on the\\nstage, they will be used in different combinations or\\nsequences to effect an appropriate strategy for the type\\nand stage of the disease being treated.\\nSURGERY. Historically, surgical removal of the\\nentire breast and axillary contents along with the muscles\\ndown to the chest wall was performed as the lone thera-\\npy, (radical mastectomy ). In the last twenty-five years,\\nas it has been appreciated that breast cancer is often sys-\\ntemic early in its course, the role of surgery is still prima-\\nry but of less and less magnitude.\\nToday, surgical treatment is best thought of as a\\ncombination of removal of the primary tumor and stag-\\ning of the axillary lymph nodes. If the whole breast is\\nremoved along with the entire axillary contents, but the\\nmuscles of the chest wall are not, the modified radical\\nmastectomy has been performed.\\nIf the tumor is less than 1.5 in (4 cm) in size and\\nlocated so that it can be removed without destroying a\\nreasonable cosmetic appearance of the residual breast,\\njust the primary tumor and a rim of normal tissue will be\\nremoved. The axillary nodes will still be removed for\\nstaging purposes, usually through a separate incision.\\nBecause of the risk of recurrence in the remaining breast\\ntissue, radiation is used to lessen the chance of local\\nrecurrence. This type of primary therapy is known as\\nlumpectomy , (or segmental mastectomy), and axillary\\ndissection.\\nCurrently the necessary extent of the axillary dissec-\\ntion is being questioned. Sentinel lymph node biopsy,a\\ntechnique for identifying which nodes in the axilla drain\\nthe tumor, has been developed to provide selective sam-\\npling and further lessen the degree of surgical trauma the\\npatient experiences.\\nWhen patients are selected appropriately based on\\nthe preoperative clinical stage, all of these surgical\\napproaches have been shown to produce similar results.\\nIn planning primary surgical therapy, it is imperative that\\nthe operation is tailored to fit the clinical circumstance of\\nthe patient.\\nThe pathologic stage is determined after surgical\\ntreatment absolutely defines the local parameters. In\\naddition to stage, there are other tests that are very neces-\\nsary to aid in decisions regarding treatment. Handling of\\nthe surgical specimen is thus very important. The tissue\\nneeds to be analyzed for the presence or absence of hor-\\nmone receptors and a receptor called HER-2.

Microscopic evaluation may also include the\\nassessment of lymphatic or blood vessel invasion as\\nthese predict a worse outcome. The DNA of the tumor\\ncells is quantitatively analyzed to help decide the biolog-\\nic aggressiveness of the tumor. These parameters will be\\nutilized collectively along with the axillary lymph node\\nstatus to define the anticipated aggressiveness of the can-\\ncer. This assessment, along with the age and general con-\\ndition of the patient, will be considered when planning\\nthe adjuvant therapies. Adjuvant therapies are treatments\\nutilized after the primary treatment to help ensure that no\\nmicroscopic disease exists and to help prolong patients’\\nsurvival time.\\nRADIATION. Like surgical therapy,radiation thera-\\npy is a local modality—it treats the tissue exposed to it\\nand not the rest of the body. Radiation is usually given\\npost-operatively after surgical wounds have healed. The\\npathologic stage of the primary tumor is now known and\\nthis aids in treatment planning. The extent of the local\\nsurgery also influences the planning. Radiation may not\\nbe needed at all after modified radical mastectomy for\\nstage I disease, but is almost always utilized when breast-\\npreserving surgery is performed. If the tumor was exten-\\nsive or if multiple nodes were involved, the field of tissue\\nexposed will vary accordingly. Radiation is utilized as an\\nadjunct to surgical therapy and is considered an important\\nmodality in gaining local control of the tumor. The use of\\nradiation therapy does not affect decisions for adjuvant\\ntreatment. In the past, radiation was used as an alternative\\nto surgery on occasion. However, now that breast-pre-\\nserving surgical protocols have been developed, primary\\nradiation treatment of the tumor is no longer performed.\\nRadiation also has an important role in the treatment of\\nthe patient with disseminated disease, particularly if it\\ninvolves the skeleton. Radiation therapy can effect pain\\ncontrol and prevention of fracture in this circumstance.\\nDRUG THERAPY. Many breast cancers, particularly\\nthose originating in post-menopausal women, are\\nresponsive to hormones. These cancers have receptors on\\ntheir cells for estrogen and progesterone. Part of primary\\ntumor assessment after removal of the tumor is the evalu-\\nation for the presence of these estrogen and progesterone\\nreceptors. If they are present on the cancer cells, altering\\nthe hormone status of the patient will inhibit tumor\\ngrowth and have a positive impact on survival. The drug\\ntamoxifen binds up these receptors on the cancer cells so\\nthat the hormones can’t have an effect and, in so doing,\\ninhibits tumor growth. If the patient has these receptors\\npresent, tamoxifen is commonly prescribed for five years\\nas an adjunct to primary treatment. Adjuvant hormonal\\ntherapy with tamoxifen has few side effects but they have\\nto be kept in mind, particularly the need for yearly evalu-\\nation of the uterus. Other agents directed at altering hor-\\nmone environment are under study. Because of these\\nagents, there is rarely any need for surgical removal of\\nhormone-producing glands, such as the ovary or adrenal,\\nthat was sometimes necessary in the past.\\nShortly after the modified radical mastectomy\\nreplaced the radical mastectomy as primary surgical\\ntreatment, it was appreciated that survival after local\\ntreatment in stage II breast cancer was improved by the\\naddition of chemotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy for an\\ninterval of four to six months is now standard treatment\\nfor patients with stage II disease. The addition of sys-\\ntemic therapy to local treatment in patients who have no\\nevidence of disease is performed on the basis that some\\npatients have metastasis that are not currently demonstra-\\nble because they are microscopic. By treating the whole\\npatient early, before widespread disease is diagnosed, the\\nadjuvant treatment improves survival rates from roughly\\n60% for stage II to about 75% at five years after treat-\\nment. The standard regimen of cytoxan, methotrexate,\\nand 5-flourouracil, (CMF), is given for six months and is\\nwell tolerated. The regimen of cytoxan, adriamycin (dox-\\norubicin), and 5-floururacil, (CAF), is a bit more toxic\\nbut only requires four months. (Adriamycin and cytoxin\\nmay also be used alone, without the fluorouracil.) The\\ntwo methods are about equivalent in results. Adjuvant\\nhormonal therapy may be added to the adjuvant chemo-\\ntherapy as they work through different routes.\\nAs one would expect, the encouraging results from\\nadjuvant therapy in stage II disease have led to the study\\nof similar therapy in stage I disease. The results are not\\nas dramatic, but they are real. Currently, stage I disease is\\ndivided into categories a, b, and c on the basis of tumor\\nsize. Stage Ia is less than a centimeter in diameter. Adju-\\nvant hormonal or chemotherapy is now commonly rec-\\nommended for stage Ib and Ic patients. The toxicity of\\nthe treatment must be weighed individually for the\\npatient as patients with stage I disease have a survivor-\\nship of over 80% without adjuvant chemotherapy.\\nIf patients are diagnosed with stage IV disease or, in\\nspite of treatment, progress to a state of widespread dis-\\nease, systemic chemotherapy is utilized in a more\\naggressive fashion. In addition to the adriamycin-con-\\ntaining regimens, the taxols (docetaxel and paclitaxel)\\nhave been found to be effective in inducing remission.\\nOn the basis of prognostic factors such as total num-\\nber of involved nodes over 10, aneuploid DNA with a\\nhigh synthesis value, or aggressive findings on micro-\\nscopic evaluation, some patients with stage II or III dis-\\nease can be predicted to do poorly. If their performance\\nstatus allows, they can be considered for treatment with\\nhighly aggressive chemotherapy. The toxicity is such that\\nbone marrow failure will result.

Another NSABP study, known as STAR, is seek-\\ning to understand if another drug, raloxifene, is as effec-\\ntive as tamoxifen in reducing breast cancer risk in high-\\nrisk patients.

Breast-shaped sacks made of a sili-\\ncone outer shell and filled with silicone gel or saline (salt\\nwater), called implants, are used.\\nPurpose\\nBreast implantation is usually performed to make\\nnormal breasts larger for cosmetic purposes.

It may be done under local or general\\nanesthesia, depending on patient and physician prefer-\\nence. The incision is made through the armpit, under the\\nbreast, or around the areola (the darkened area around\\nthe nipple). These techniques create the most inconspicu-\\nous scars.

However, if enlargement is part of breast recon-\\nstruction after a mastectomy, health plans may pay for\\nsome or all of it. The surgeon’s fee ranges from $2,700-\\n$4,200 and up. The procedure may also be called breast\\naugmentation or augmentation mammaplasty.\\nPreparation\\nBefore the surgery is performed, the woman should\\nhave a clear understanding of what her new breasts will\\nlook like. She and her physician should agree about the\\ndesired final result. Many surgeons find it helpful to have\\nthe patient review before and after pictures, to clarify\\nexpectations.\\nAftercare\\nDriving and normal activities may be restricted for\\nup to one week. Stitches are usually removed in seven to\\n10 days. Typically, a woman can resume all routines,\\nincluding vigorous exercise , in about three weeks. The\\nscars will be red for approximately one month, but will\\nfade to their final appearance within one or two years.\\nRisks\\nRisks which are common to any surgical procedure\\ninclude bleeding, infection, anesthesia reaction, or unex-\\npected scarring. A breast enlargement may also result in\\ndecreased sensation in the breast, or interference with\\nbreast-feeding. Implants can also make it more difficult\\nto read and interpret mammograms, possibly delaying\\nbreast cancerdetection. Also, the implant itself can rup-\\nture and leak, or become displaced. A thick scar that nor-\\nmally forms around the implant, called a capsule, can\\nbecome very hard. This is called capsular contracture,\\nand may result in pain and/or an altered appearance of\\nthe breast. The older the implant, the greater the chances\\nthat these problems will occur.\\nThere has been intermittent publicity about possible\\nhealth risks from breast implants. Most concerns have\\nfocused on silicone gel-filled implants. As of 1992, the\\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) restricted the use of\\nthis type of implant, and ordered further studies.

Reconstructions are\\ncommonly done after one or both breasts are removed as\\na treatment for breast cancer. Also, a breast may need to\\nbe refashioned for other reasons, such as trauma or\\nabnormalities that occur during breast development.\\nPurpose\\nMany authorities consider reconstruction an integral\\npart of the therapy for breast cancer. A breast that\\nappears natural offers a sense of wholeness and normal-\\ncy, which can aid in the psychological recovery from\\nbreast cancer. It eliminates the need for an external pros-\\nthesis (false breast), which many women find physically\\nuncomfortable as well as inconvenient.\\nPrecautions\\nNot all women are good candidates for breast recon-\\nstruction. Overall poor physical health, or specific prob-\\nlems such as cigarette smoking , obesity , high blood\\npressure, or diabetes, will increase the chance of compli-\\ncations. Also, a difficult and/or prolonged recovery peri-\\nod or failure of the reconstruction may be a result. A\\nwoman’s physical ability to cope with major surgery and\\nrecuperation also need to be considered.\\nDescription\\nBreast reconstruction is done in two stages, with the\\nultimate goal of creating a breast which looks and feels\\nas natural as possible.

The second step involves creating a\\nbalance between the newly constructed breast and the\\nbreast on the opposite side. The nipple and areolar complex\\n(darker area around the nipple) are recreated. This is usual-\\nly done several months after the mound is created, to allow\\nswelling to go down. Other procedures may be necessary,\\nsuch as lifting the opposite breast (mastopexy), or making\\nit larger or smaller to match the reconstructed breast.\\nTiming, immediate or delayed reconstruction\\nWhile immediate reconstruction (IR) is not recom-\\nmended for women with breast cancer who need to under-\\ngo other, more important treatments, breast reconstruction\\ncan be done almost anytime. It even can be done during the\\nsame procedure as the mastectomy, or it can be delayed.\\nThere are psychological benefits to IR. The ability to return\\nto normal activities and routines is often enhanced when\\nreconstruction follows immediately after mastectomy. A\\nbetter appearance may result from IR. There is less skin\\nremoval, often resulting in a shorter scar. The surgeon is\\nbetter able to preserve the normal boundaries of the breast,\\nso it is easier to match the opposite breast more closely.\\nThe cost of IR is generally lower than the cost of\\ndelayed reconstruction (DR). There is one fewer opera-\\ntion and hospital stay. Surgeon’s fees may be lower for a\\ncombined procedure than for two separate surgeries.\\nThere are disadvantages of IR as well. The surgery\\nitself is longer, causing more time under anesthesia.\\nPost-operative pain and recovery time will be greater\\nthan for mastectomy alone.\\nOther authorities contend that delayed reconstruc-\\ntion (DR) offers different physical and psychological\\nadvantages. The initial mastectomy procedure alone\\ntakes less time, and has a shorter recovery period and less\\npain than mastectomy and IR. The patient has more time\\nto adjust to her diagnosis and recover from additional\\ntherapy. She is better able to research her options, and to\\nformulate realistic goals for reconstruction. Some recon-\\nstructive surgery requires blood transfusions. With DR,\\nthe patient can donate her own blood ahead of time\\n(autologous transfusion), and/or arrange to have family\\nand friends donate blood for her use (directed donation).\\nThe psychological stress of living without a breast is\\na disadvantage of DR. The extra procedure DR entails\\nresults in higher costs. Although initial recovery is faster,\\nan additional recuperation period is required after the\\ndelayed operation.\\nType of reconstruction\\nThere are two basic choices for breast reconstruc-\\ntion. The breast tissue can be replaced with an implant or\\nthe breast is created using some of the woman’s own tis-\\nsues (autologous reconstruction).\\nARTIFICIAL IMPLANTS. In general, implant proce-\\ndures take less time, and are less expensive than autolo-\\ngous ones. Implants are breast shaped pouches. They are\\nmade of silicone outer shells, which may be smooth or\\ntextured. The inside may contain silicone gel, saline (salt\\nwater), or a combination of both.\\nAn implant may be a fixed volume type, which can-\\nnot change its size. Implants that have the capacity to be\\nfilled after insertion are called tissue expanders. These\\nmay be temporary or permanent.\\nThe initial procedure for any implant insertion uses\\nthe mastectomy incision to make a pocket of tissue, usu-\\nally underneath the chest wall muscle. In DR, the mas-\\ntectomy scar may be re opened and used for this purpose,\\nor a more cosmetic incision may be made. The implant is\\ninserted into the pocket, the skin is stretched as needed\\nand stitched closed.\\nIf there is inadequate tissue to achieve the desired size,\\nor a naturally sagging breast is desired, a tissue expander is\\nused. It resembles a partially deflated balloon, with an\\nattached valve or port through which saline can be injected.\\nAfter the initial surgical incision is healed, the woman\\nreturns to the doctor’s office, on a weekly or bi-weekly\\nbasis, to have small amounts of saline injected. Injections\\ncan continue for about six to eight weeks, until the preferred\\nsize is obtained. In some cases it may be overfilled, and later\\npartially deflated to allow for a more pliable, natural result.\\nA temporary tissue expander will be removed after several\\nmonths and replaced with a permanent implant.\\nIR surgery using an implant takes approximately\\ntwo to three hours, and usually requires up to a three day\\nhospital stay. Implant insertion surgery, as part of DR,\\ntakes one to two hours and can sometimes be done as an\\noutpatient, or it or it may entail overnight hospitalization.\\nAUTOLOGUS RECONSTRUCTION. Attached flap and\\nfree flap are two types of surgery where a woman’s tissue\\nis used in reconstruction. An attached flap uses skin, mus-\\ncle, and fat, leaving blood vessels attached to their origi-\\nnal source of blood. The flap is maneuvered to the recon-\\nstruction site, keeping its original blood supply for nour-\\nishment. This may also be known as a pedicle flap. The\\nsecond kind of surgery is called a free flap. This also uses\\nskin, muscle, and fat, but severs the blood vessels, and\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 587\\nBreast reconstruction\\nGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 587'),\n",

The surgeon uses a microscope to accomplish\\nthis delicate task of sewing blood vessels together. Some-\\ntimes the term microsurgery is used to refer to free flap\\nprocedures. Either type of surgery may also be called a\\nmyocutaneous flap, referring to the skin and muscle used.\\nThe skin and muscle used in autologous reconstruc-\\ntion can come from one of several possible places on the\\nbody, including the abdomen (TRAM flap or “tummy\\ntuck”), the back (latissimus dorsi flap), or the buttocks\\n(gluteus maximus free flap).\\nFinishing the reconstruction\\nOther procedures may be necessary to achieve the goal\\nof symmetrical breasts. It may be necessary to make the\\nopposite breast larger (augmentation), smaller (reduction),\\nor higher (mastopexy).

Tissue to form the new nipple may come from the\\nreconstructed breast itself, the opposite breast, or a more\\ndistant donor site, such as the inner thigh or behind the ear.\\nThe nipple and areolar construction is usually an outpatient\\nprocedure.

By regularly examining her own breasts, a\\nwoman is more likely to find any changes that may have\\noccurred. The best time to perform a BSE is about a week\\nafter a woman’s period ends, when her breasts are not ten-\\nder or swollen. If her periods are not regular, a BSE\\nshould be completed on the same day every month. A\\nBSE should also be regularly completed by women who\\nare pregnant, breastfeeding, or have breast implants. By\\ncombining a BSE with a mammography and clinical\\nbreast examination, a woman is offered the best opportu-\\nnity for reducing chances of death from breast cancer\\nthrough early detection. Close to 90% of breast cancers\\nare found through a BSE. The American Cancer Society\\nrecommends that beginning at the age of 20, women com-\\nplete a BSE each month by feeling for lumps or anything\\nsuspicious, as well as looking at their breasts carefully in\\na mirror for any changes in contour, swelling, dimpling,\\npuckering of the skin, or changes in the nipple.\\nDescription\\nTo complete a monthly BSE:\\n• When lying down, place a pillow under the right shoul-\\nder and position the right arm behind the head.

The sound waves pass through the\\nbreast and bounce back or echo from various tissues to\\nform a picture of the internal structures. It is not invasive\\nand involves no radiation.\\nPurpose\\nBreast ultrasound may be used in several ways. The\\nmost common application is to investigate a specific area\\nof the breast where a problem is suspected. A palpable\\nlump and/or a lump or density discovered by x ray\\n(mammogram) can be further evaluated by ultrasound. It\\nis especially helpful in distinguishing between a fluid-\\nfilled cyst and a solid mass. It can also identify small\\nlesions that are too tiny to be felt.\\nBreast ultrasound is often the first study performed to\\nevaluate masses in women under 35 whose mammograms\\ncan be difficult to interpret due to the density of their\\nbreast tissue. The lack of radiation used with ultrasound\\nmakes it ideal for studying breast abnormalities in women\\nwho are pregnant. Assessing breast implants for leakage\\nor rupture is another way ultrasound is used. Breast\\ninflammation, where pockets of infection or abscesses\\nmay form, can be diagnosed and monitored by ultrasound.\\nThickened and swollen breast skin may be a sign of\\ninflammatory breast cancer. Ultrasound can sometimes\\nidentify a cancerous growth within the breast causing the\\nthickened skin. These cases are usually followed by a\\ncore biopsy guided by ultrasound (described below).\\nBreast ultrasound is employed to observe and guide a\\nneedle for several interventional procedures.

Patients usually\\nfind that the procedure is less traumatic and more comfort-\\nable than surgical biopsies.

Biopsies guided by ultrasound are generally less costly\\nthan surgical biopsies. Additionally, if the abnormality that\\nrequires biopsy can be seen on both a mammogram and\\nultrasound, an ultrasound-guided biopsy is often more\\ncomfortable for the patient as no compression is necessary.\\nDescription\\nUltrasound can be done in a doctor’s office or anoth-\\ner outpatient setting, such as a hospital or imaging center.\\nThe patient removes her clothing from the waist up\\nand puts on a hospital gown, open in the front. She lies\\non her back or side on an examining table. A gel that\\nenhances sound transmission is spread over the area to be\\nexamined. The technologist then places a transducer, an\\ninstrument about the size of an electric shaver, against\\nthe skin. The images from reflected sound waves appear\\non a monitor screen.\\nA good ultrasound study is difficult to obtain if the\\npatient is unable to remain quietly in one position.

Between 3-4% of fetuses will start labor in the\\nbreech position, which is a potentially dangerous situation.\\nDescription\\nThroughout most of pregnancy , the developing\\nfetus is completely free to move around within the\\nuterus. Between 32-36 weeks, it becomes so large that\\nmovement is restricted. It is much harder for the fetus to\\nturn over, so whatever position it has assumed by this\\npoint is likely to be the same position that he or she will\\nbe in when labor begins.\\nFor reasons that are not fully understood, almost all\\nunborn babies settle into a head down position. The fetus\\nis upside down in the uterus, and the head will lead the\\nway during the birth process.\\nUnfortunately, some fetuses do not cooperate. Most\\nof these are in the breech position. The buttocks lead the\\nway out of the uterus, and the legs are folded in front of\\nthe body (frank breech). Delivery from the breech posi-\\ntion poses far more risks than delivery head first (vertex\\nposition).\\nThe biggest part of the fetus’s body is usually its\\nhead. If the head fits through the mother’s pelvis, then\\nthe rest of the fetus’s body should slip out fairly easily. If\\nthe fetus is born bottom first, it is possible that the body\\nwill fit through the mother’s pelvis, but the baby’s head\\nwill get stuck at the level of the chin. This condition,\\nknown as a trapped head, is very dangerous.\\nWhen the baby’s head comes first, it has a chance to\\n“mold” during labor. The bones of the baby’s skull are\\nnot yet fastened together the way they are in a child or\\nadult’s skull, meaning that the bones of the baby’s skull\\ncan move. During the long hours of labor the skull can\\nchange shape to fit through the pelvis more easily, which\\nis why many babies are born with a “cone head”. If the\\nbaby is born from the breech position, the skull does not\\nhave a chance to change shape to fit the pelvis, and it is\\neven more likely to get stuck.\\nIf the baby’s head gets trapped, the possibility of\\ninjury is high. Once the baby’s body is born, the umbilical\\ncord usually stops pulsating (just as it would during a nor-\\nmal delivery). This cuts off the oxygen supply from the\\nmother to the baby. If the baby’s head is still inside the\\nuterus the baby cannot yet breathe on its own. Therefore,\\nit is essential to deliver the baby as quickly as possible.\\nThe life saving attempts to deliver the baby’s head\\ncan cause injury to the baby’s neck or head resulting in\\npermanent handicaps. In extreme cases, if the baby can-\\nnot be delivered within a few minutes, the baby might\\ndie. Obviously, it is critical to avoid a breech delivery\\nwith a trapped head.\\nOf course, many babies are safely delivered from the\\nbreech position. There are certain factors that make a\\nbreech delivery more likely to be successful: if ultra-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2594\\nBreech birth\\nGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 594'),\n",

This is not true for\\npremature babies. Premature babies are more likely to have\\na trapped head because the body of a premature baby is\\nusually much smaller than his or her head. Premature\\nbabies are generally not delivered from the breech position.\\nThe risks of vaginal breech delivery can be avoided by\\ndelivering the baby through a surgical procedure (cesarean\\nsection, also known as c-section). For the past twenty\\nyears, cesarean section has been recommended when the\\nfetus is breech. More recently, many providers have offered\\nthe option of version, attempting to turn the fetus within the\\nuterus to a head first position before labor begins.\\nVersion is based on a very simple idea. If a fetus in\\nthe breech position does a somersault, it will end up head\\ndown. During a version, the obstetrician tries to make the\\nfetus do a somersault.\\nA version should only be done in a hospital, with an\\nultrasound machine used to guide the obstetrician in\\nturning the fetus. The fetus should be monitored with a\\nfetal monitor before and after the version. Some obstetri-\\ncians give the mother an injection of medication to relax\\nthe mother’s uterus and prevent any contractions.\\nDuring the procedure, the obstetrician places his or\\nher hands on the mother’s abdomen to feel the location of\\nthe unborn baby’s buttocks and head. The buttocks are\\nlifted up slightly and the doctor pushes on the baby’s\\nhead to encourage him to perform a somersault. It may\\ntake several tries before the fetus cooperates, but over\\nhalf will eventually turn.\\nA version is not appropriate for every fetus who is in\\nthe breech position at the end of pregnancy. It can only be\\ntried if there is one fetus in the uterus, if the placenta is not\\nlying in front of the fetus, and if the umbilical cord does\\nnot appear to be wrapped around the fetus at any point.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe cause of breech birth is not known. There are\\ngenerally no identifiable symptoms. However, some\\nwomen can tell the position of the fetus by where they\\nfeel the fetus kicking. Most women cannot tell what\\nposition the fetus is in at any given moment.\\nDiagnosis\\nA health care provider can often tell the position of\\nthe fetus by feeling it through the wall of the mother’s\\nabdomen. Another clue to the position is the location\\nwhere the heartbeat is heard best. If the fetus’s heartbeat\\nis best heard below the level of the mother’s navel, it is\\nlikely to be positioned head first. On the other hand, if\\nthe heartbeat is best heard above the level of the navel, it\\nis likely to be breech.\\nThe only way to really be sure, however, is to do an\\nultrasound exam. Using this technique it is very easy to\\ntell the position of the fetus.\\nTreatment\\nIf a fetus is in the breech position in the last weeks of\\npregnancy, there are three possible courses of action: Cesare-\\nan section, attempted version, or vaginal breech delivery.\\nCesarean section is the most common way to deliver\\na breech baby. This surgical procedure carries more risk\\nfor the mother, but many women prefer to take the risk of\\nsurgery on themselves rather than let the baby face the\\nrisks of breech delivery.\\nVersion is gaining in popularity. Version is a medical\\nprocedure in which the obstetrician tries to turn the\\nbreech fetus to the head first position. Version is success-\\nful more than 50% of the time.

In bronchiectasis, the diameter of the bronchi is\\nunusually large. Examination of the walls of the bronchial\\ntubes reveals destruction of the normal structural elements,\\nwith replacement by scar tissue. Pus collects within the\\nbronchi, and the normal flow of oxygen into the lungs, and\\ncarbon dioxide out of the lungs (air exchange) is impaired.\\nThe bronchi show signs of inflammation, with swelling\\nand invasion by a variety of immune cells. The inflamed\\nareas show signs of increased growth of blood vessels. The\\narea of the lung which should be served by a diseased\\nbronchial tube is also prone to inflammation and infection.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nPrior to the widespread use of immunizations,\\nbronchiectasis was often the result of a serious infection\\nwith either measles or whooping cough . Currently,\\nviruses that cause influenza (flu) or influenza-like syn-\\ndromes, as well as a number of bacteria may precede the\\ndevelopment of bronchiectasis. Patients who have been\\ninfected with tuberculosis or the virus which causes\\nAIDS (HIV or human immunodeficiency virus) also\\nhave an increased chance of bronchiectasis.\\nA number of pre-existing conditions may cause an\\nindividual to be more susceptible than normal to infec-\\ntion, with increased risk of bronchiectasis developing.\\nThese conditions include disorders of cilia, and immune\\ndisorders.\\nCilia are the tiny hairs which usually line the\\nbronchial tubes. Cilia wave constantly, sweeping the\\nbronchial tubes clean of bacterial or viral invaders, and\\ncleaning away excess secretions (mucus, sputum) which\\nmay be produced by the bronchi. When these cilia are\\nabnormal or absent at birth, various bacterial or viral\\ninvaders may remain in the respiratory tract, multiply,\\nand cause serious infections.\\nImmune disorders include decreased production of\\ncertain immune chemicals (immunoglobulins) which\\nusually serve to fight off infection by bacterial or viral\\ninvasion. When these immunoglobulins are not produced\\nin large enough quantity, bacterial and viral invaders are\\nnot effectively killed off, and infection occurs.\\nOther causes of bronchiectasis include an abnormal-\\nly blocked (obstructed) airway. This can be due to tumor\\ngrowth within the bronchial tube, or due to a child acci-\\ndentally inhaling a small object which then blocks off the\\nbronchial tube. People with the disease called cystic\\nfibrosis (CF) often have their bronchial tubes obstructed\\nby the thick, sticky mucus which is a hallmark of CF.\\nToxic exposures (breathing ammonia, for example) can\\nharm the bronchi, and lead to bronchiectasis. An extreme\\nallergic response of the immune system to the presence\\nof certain fungi (especially one called Aspergillus ) can\\nalso damage the bronchial tubes enough to result in\\nbronchiectasis.\\nSymptoms of bronchiectasis include constant cough\\nand the production of infected sputum (sputum is a mix-\\nture of mucus and pus), which may be bloody. In some\\ncases, there may be wheezing and shortness of breath .\\nThe constant, low-level of infection may flare, resulting\\nin increased production of sputum, worsening of the\\ncough, and fever. The area of the lung served by the\\naffected bronchial tube may become severely infected,\\nresulting in pneumonia.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2596\\nBronchiectasis\\nGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 596'),\n",

Sputum will\\nneed to be collected and cultured (grown in a laboratory\\ndish), in order to examine it microscopically for the spe-\\ncific type of organism responsible for infection. A careful\\nsearch for other underlying diseases is important, look-\\ning in particular for ciliary abnormalities, cystic fibrosis,\\nor immunoglobulin deficiencies.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment should involve efforts to resolve any\\nunderlying disorder.

Bronchitis can either be of\\nbrief duration (acute) or have a long course (chronic).\\nAcute bronchitis is usually caused by a viral infection, but\\ncan also be caused by a bacterial infection and can heal\\nwithout complications. Chronic bronchitis is a sign of seri-\\nous lung disease that may be slowed but cannot be cured.\\nDescription\\nAlthough acute and chronic bronchitis are both\\ninflammations of the air passages, their causes and treat-\\nments are different. Acute bronchitis is most prevalent in\\nwinter. It usually follows a viral infection, such as a cold\\nor the flu, and can be accompanied by a secondary bacter-\\nial infection. Acute bronchitis resolves within two weeks,\\nalthough the cough may persist longer. Acute bronchitis,\\nlike any upper airway inflammatory process, can increase\\na person’s likelihood of developing pneumonia.\\nAnyone can get acute bronchitis, but infants, young\\nchildren, and the elderly are more likely to get the dis-\\nease because people in these age groups generally have\\nweaker immune systems. Smokers and people with heart\\nor other lung diseases are also at higher risk of develop-\\ning acute bronchitis. Individuals exposed to chemical\\nfumes or high levels of air pollution also have a greater\\nchance of developing acute bronchitis.\\nChronic bronchitis is a major cause of disability and\\ndeath in the United States. The American Lung Associa-\\ntion estimates that about 14 million Americans suffer\\nfrom the disease. Like acute bronchitis, chronic bronchi-\\ntis is an inflammation of airways accompanied by cough-\\ning and spitting up of phlegm. In chronic bronchitis,\\nthese symptoms are present for at least three months in\\neach of two consecutive years.\\nChronic bronchitis is caused by inhaling bronchial\\nirritants, especially cigarette smoke. Until recently, more\\nmen than women developed chronic bronchitis, but as\\nthe number of women who smoke has increased, so has\\ntheir rate of chronic bronchitis. Because this disease pro-\\ngresses slowly, middle-aged and older people are more\\nlikely to be diagnosed with chronic bronchitis.\\nChronic bronchitis is one of a group of diseases that\\nfall under the name chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-\\nease (COPD). Other diseases in this category include\\nemphysemaand chronic asthmatic bronchitis. Chronic\\nbronchitis may progress to emphysema, or both diseases\\nmay be present together.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAcute bronchitis\\nAcute bronchitis usually begins with the symptoms\\nof a cold, such as a runny nose, sneezing, and dry cough.\\nHowever, the cough soon becomes deep and painful.\\nCoughing brings up a greenish yellow phlegm or sputum.\\nThese symptoms may be accompanied by a fever of up\\nto 102°F (38.8°C). Wheezing after coughing is common.\\nIn uncomplicated acute bronchitis, the fever and\\nmost other symptoms, except the cough, disappear after\\nthree to five days. Coughing may continue for several\\nweeks. Acute bronchitis is often complicated by a bacter-\\nial infection, in which case the fever and a general feel-\\ning of illness persist. To be cured, the bacterial infection\\nshould be treated with antibiotics.\\nChronic bronchitis\\nChronic bronchitis is caused by inhaling respiratory\\ntract irritants. The most common irritant is cigarette\\nsmoke. The American Lung Association estimates that\\n80-90% of COPD cases are caused by smoking . Other\\nirritants include chemical fumes, air pollution, and envi-\\nronmental irritants, such as mold or dust.\\nChronic bronchitis develops slowly over time. The\\ncells that line the respiratory system contain fine, hair-\\nlike outgrowths from the cell called cilia. Normally, the\\ncilia of many cells beat rhythmically to move mucus\\nalong the airways. When smoke or other irritants are\\ninhaled, the cilia become paralyzed or snap off. When\\nthis occurs, the cilia are no longer able to move mucus,\\nand the airways become inflamed, narrowed, and\\nclogged. This leads to difficulty breathing and can\\nprogress to the life-threatening disease emphysema.\\nA mild cough, sometimes called smokers’ cough, is\\nusually the first visible sign of chronic bronchitis.\\nCoughing brings up phlegm, although the amount varies\\nconsiderably from person to person. Wheezing and\\nshortness of breathmay accompany the cough. Diag-\\nnostic tests show a decrease in lung function. As the dis-\\nease advances, breathing becomes difficult and activity\\ndecreases. The body does not get enough oxygen, lead-\\ning to changes in the composition of the blood.\\nDiagnosis\\nInitial diagnosis of bronchitis is based on observing\\nthe patient’s symptoms and health history. The physician\\nwill listen to the patient’s chest with a stethoscope for\\nspecific sounds that indicate lung inflammation, such as\\nmoist rales and crackling, and wheezing, that indicates\\nairway narrowing. Moist rales is a bubbling sound heard\\nwith a stethoscope that is caused by fluid secretion in the\\nbronchial tubes.\\nA sputum culture may be performed, particularly if\\nthe sputum is green or has blood in it, to determine whether\\na bacterial infection is present and to identify the disease-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2598\\nBronchitis\\nGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 598'),\n",

The\\nresults are available in two to three days, except for tests for\\ntuberculosis, which can take as long as two months.\\nOccasionally, in diagnosing a chronic lung disorder,\\nthe sample of sputum is collected using a procedure\\ncalled a bronchoscopy . In this procedure, the patient is\\ngiven a local anesthetic, and a tube is passed into the air-\\nways to collect a sputum sample.\\nA pulmonary function test is important in diagnos-\\ning chronic bronchitis and other variations of COPD.\\nThis test uses an instrument called a spirometer to mea-\\nsure the volume of air entering and leaving the lungs.\\nThe test is done in the doctor’s office and is painless.

An electrocar-\\ndiogram is an instrument that is used to measure the elec-\\ntrical activity of the heart and is useful in the diagnosis of\\nheart conditions. Other tests may be used to measure how\\neffectively oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged in\\nthe lungs.\\nTreatment\\nAcute bronchitis\\nWhen no secondary infection is present, acute bron-\\nchitis is treated in the same way as the common cold .\\nHome care includes drinking plenty of fluids, resting, not\\nsmoking, increasing moisture in the air with a cool mist\\nhumidifier, and taking acetaminophen (Datril, Tylenol,\\nPanadol) for fever and pain.

Nor-\\nmally, air moves smoothly from the mouth and nose\\nthrough the airways and into the tiny air sacs of the lungs\\nas a person breathes in. Breathing out (exhaling) happens\\nautomatically when the person stops breathing in. In a\\nperson with asthma, breathing in (inhaling) is not a prob-\\nlem. Incoming air can slide around the blockage, because\\nthe act of breathing in makes the airways expand. The\\nproblem comes when the person with asthma tries to\\nbreathe out. The air can no longer get past the blockage,\\nand it remains trapped in the lungs. The person can then\\nonly take shallow breaths. Bronchodilators work by\\nrelaxing the smooth muscles that line the airways. This\\nmakes the airways open wider and allows air to leave the\\nlungs. These drugs also are used to relieve breathing\\nproblems associated with emphysema, chronic bronchi-\\ntis, and other lung diseases.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2600\\nBronchodilators\\nGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 600'),\n",

Be\\nsure to carefully read them before using the medicine. If\\nthere is any confusion about how to use the medicine,\\ncheck with the physician or pharmacist. Always use these\\nmedicines exactly as directed. Taking larger than recom-\\nmended doses or using the medicine too often can lead to\\nserious side effects and even death.\\nIf symptoms do not improve or if they get worse\\nafter using a bronchodilator, call a physician right away.\\nAlthough some bronchodilators are available with-\\nout a physician’s prescription, these medicines should\\nnot be used unless a physician has diagnosed the\\npatient’s condition as asthma.\\nSome asthma experts believe that the overuse of\\nbronchodilators can cause asthma to get worse. They\\nadvise patients and their physicians to consider control-\\nling asthma with anti-inflammatory drugs including\\ninhaled steroids such as beclomethasone dipropionate\\n(Beclovent, Vanceril), flunisolide (AeroBid) or triamci-\\nnolone acetonide (Azmacort) Ideally, asthma should be\\ncontrolled with an inhaled steroid that is used along with\\nthe bronchodilator. The more the inhaled steroid steroid\\ncontrols the inflammation that causes the asthma, the less\\nbronchodilator the patient needs to use because symp-\\ntoms are under control.\\nPersons with diabetes should be aware that the bron-\\nchodilator epinephrine may raise their blood sugar levels.\\nPatients who are using an aerosol bronchodilator and\\nan aerosol form of either ipratropium or a corticosteroid\\nsuch as beclomethasone dipropionate (Beclovent,\\nVanceril) should use the bronchodilator first, then wait 5\\nminutes before using the other medicine. Check with a\\nphysician before using any other inhaled medications or\\nother asthma medicines. The physician must determine\\nthe proper amount of time between doses.\\nSome bronchodilator products contain sulfites, that\\ntrigger an allergic reaction in certain people. Anyone\\nwho has a sulfite allergy should read the label carefully\\nor check with a physician or pharmacist before using a\\nbronchodilator. Call a physician immediately if any of\\nthese signs of an allergic reaction to sulfite occur:\\n• bluish coloration of the skin\\n• flushed or red face or skin\\n• faintness\\n• severe dizziness\\n• increased wheezing or other breathing problems\\n• skin rash,hives, or itching\\n• swelling of the face, lips, or eyelids\\nSpecial conditions\\nPeople with certain medical conditions or who are\\ntaking certain other medicines can have problems if they\\nuse bronchodilators. Before using these drugs, be sure to\\nlet the physician know about any of these conditions:\\nALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reactions\\nto any bronchodilator or an inhaled form of any other\\ndrug in the past should let his or her physician know\\nbefore taking the drugs again. The physician should also\\nbe told about any allergies to foods, dyes, preservatives,\\nor other substances.\\nPatients who are allergic to soybeans, soy lecithin,\\npeanuts, or drugs based on atropine should not use the\\nbronchodilator ipratropium (Atrovent).\\nPREGNANCY.

This scope\\ncontains a viewing device that allows the visual examina-\\ntion of the lower airways.\\nPurpose\\nDuring a bronchoscopy, a physician can visually\\nexamine the lower airways, including the larynx, trachea,\\nbronchi, and bronchioles. The procedure is used to exam-\\nine the mucosal surface of the airways for abnormalities\\nthat might be associated with a variety of lung diseases.\\nIts use includes the visualization of airway obstructions\\nsuch as a tumor, or the collection of specimens for the\\ndiagnosis of cancer originating in the bronchi of the\\nlungs (bronchogenic cancer). It can also be used to collect\\nspecimens for culture to diagnose infectious diseases such\\nas tuberculosis . The type of specimens collected can\\ninclude sputum (composed of saliva and discharges from\\nthe respiratory passages), tissue samples from the bronchi\\nor bronchioles, or cells collected from washing the lining\\nof the bronchi or bronchioles. The instrument used in\\nbronchoscopy, a bronchoscope, is a slender cylindrical\\ninstrument containing a light and an eyepiece. There are\\ntwo types of bronchoscopes, a rigid tube that is some-\\ntimes referred to as an open-tube or ventilating broncho-\\nscope, and a more flexible fiberoptic tube. This tube con-\\ntains four smaller passages—two for light to pass\\nthrough, one for seeing through and one that can accom-\\nmodate medical instruments that may be used for biopsy\\nor suctioning, or that medication can be passed through.\\nBronchoscopy may be used for the following pur-\\nposes:\\n• to diagnose cancer, tuberculosis, lung infection, or\\nother lung disease\\n• to examine an inherited deformity of the lungs\\n• to remove a foreign body in the lungs, such as a mucus\\nplug, tumor, or excessive secretions\\n• to remove tissue samples, also known as biopsy, to test\\nfor cancer cells, help with staging the advancement of\\nthe lung cancer, or to treat a tumor with laser therapy\\n• to allow examination of a suspected tumor, obstruction,\\nsecretion, bleeding, or foreign body in the airways\\n• to determine the cause of a persistent cough, wheezing,\\nor a cough that includes blood in the sputum\\n• to evaluate the effectiveness of lung cancer treatments\\nPrecautions\\nPatients not breathing adequately on their own due\\nto severe respiratory failure may require mechanical\\nventilation prior to bronchoscopy. It may not be appro-\\npriate to perform bronchoscopy on patients with an\\nunstable heart condition. All patients must be constantly\\nmonitored while undergoing a bronchoscopy so that any\\nabnormal reactions can be dealt with immediately.\\nDescription\\nThere are two types of bronchoscopes, a rigid tube\\nand a fiberoptic tube.

However, if the purpose of the\\nprocedure is to remove a foreign body caught in the wind-\\npipe or lungs of a child, the more rigid tube must be used\\nbecause of its larger size. The patient will either lie face-up\\non his/her back or sit upright in a chair. Medication to\\ndecrease secretions, lessen anxiety, and relax the patient\\nare often given prior to the procedure. While breathing\\nthrough the nose, anesthesia is sprayed into the mouth or\\nnose to numb it. It will take one to two minutes for the\\nanesthesia to take effect. Once this happens, the broncho-\\nscope will be put into the patient’s mouth or nose and\\nmoved down into the throat. While the bronchoscope is\\nmoving down the throat, additional anesthesia is put into\\nthe bronchoscope to numb the lower parts of the airways.\\nUsing the eyepiece, the physician then observes the tra-\\nchea and bronchi, and the mucosal lining of these passage-\\nways, looking for any abnormalities that may be present.\\nIf the purpose of the bronchoscopy is to take tissue\\nsamples or biopsy, forceps or a bronchial brush are used\\nto obtain cells. If the purpose is to identify an infectious\\nagent, a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) can be used to\\ngather fluid for culture purposes. Also, if any foreign\\nmatter is found in the airways, it can be removed.\\nAnother procedure using bronchoscopy is called flu-\\norescence bronchoscopy. This can be used to detect pre-\\ncancerous cells present in the airways. By using a fluo-\\nrescent light in the bronchoscope, precancerous tissue\\nwill appear dark red, while healthy tissue will appear\\ngreen. This technique can help detect lung cancer at an\\nearly stage, so that treatment can be started early.\\nAlternative procedures\\nDepending upon the purpose of the bronchoscopy,\\nalternatives might include a computed tomography scan\\n(CT) or no procedure at all. Bronchoscopy is often per-\\nformed to investigate an abnormality that shows up on a\\nchest x rayor CT scan. If the purpose is to obtain biopsy\\nspecimens, one option is to perform surgery, which carries\\ngreater risks. Another option is percutaneous (through the\\nskin) biopsy guided by computed tomography.\\nPreparation\\nThe doctor should be informed of any allergies and\\nall the medications that the patient is currently taking. The\\ndoctor may instruct the patient not to take medications\\nlike aspirin or anti-inflammatory drugs, which interfere\\nwith clotting, for a period of time prior to the procedure.\\nThe patient needs to fast for 6 to 12 hours prior to the pro-\\ncedure and refrain from drinking any liquids the day of\\nthe procedure. The bronchoscopy takes about 45 to 60\\nminutes, with results usually available in one day. Prior to\\nthe bronchoscopy, several tests may be done, including a\\nchest x ray and blood work. Sometimes a bronchoscopy is\\ndone under general anesthesia. Patients usually have an\\nintravenous (IV) line in the arm. Most likely, the proce-\\ndure will be done under local anesthesia, which is sprayed\\ninto the nose or mouth. This is necessary to decrease the\\ngag reflex. A sedative may also be used to help the patient\\nrelax. It is important that the patient understands that at no\\ntime will the airway be blocked and that oxygen can be\\nsupplied through the bronchoscope. A signed consent\\nform is necessary for this procedure.\\nAftercare\\nAfter the bronchoscopy, the patient will be monitored\\nfor vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, and\\nbreathing, while resting in bed. Sometimes patients have\\nan abnormal reaction to anesthesia. All saliva should be\\nspit into a basin so that it can be examined for the pres-\\nence of blood. If a biopsy was taken, the patient should\\nnot cough or clear the throat as this might dislodge any\\nblood clot that has formed and cause bleeding. No food or\\ndrink should be consumed for about two hours after the\\nprocedure or until the anesthesia wears off. Diet is gradu-\\nally progressed from ice chips and clear liquids to the\\npatient’s regular diet. There will also be a temporary sore\\nthroat and hoarseness that may last for a few days.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2604\\nBronchoscopy\\nBronchoscope\\nBronchoscopy is a procedure in which a hollow, flexible\\ntube is inserted into the airways, allowing the physician to\\nvisually examine the lower airways, including the larynx, tra-\\nchea, bronchi, and bronchioles.

The disease can become chronic and recur,\\nparticularly if untreated.\\nDescription\\nAlso known as undulant fever, Malta fever, Gibraltar\\nfever, Bang’s disease, or Mediterranean fever, brucellosis\\nis most likely to occur among those individuals who reg-\\nularly work with livestock. The disease originated in\\ndomestic livestock but was passed on to wild animal\\nspecies, including the elk and buffalo of the western\\nUnited States. In humans, brucellosis continues to be\\nspread via unpasteurized milk obtained from infected\\ncows or through contact with the discharges of cattle and\\ngoats during miscarriage . In areas of the world where\\nmilk is not pasteurized, for example in Latin America\\nand the Mediterranean, the disease is still contracted by\\ningesting unpasteurized dairy products. However, in the\\nUnited States, the widespread pasteurization of milk and\\nnearly complete eradication of the infection from cattle\\nhas reduced the number of human cases from 6,500 in\\n1940 to about 70 in 1994.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe disease is caused by several different species of\\nparasitic bacteria of the genus Brucella.

In the United States, the\\ndisease is primarily confined to slaughterhouse workers.\\nScientists do not agree about whether brucellosis\\ncan be transmitted from one person to another, although\\nsome people have been infected from a tainted blood\\ntransfusionor bone marrow transplant. Newborn babies\\nhave also contracted the illness from their mothers dur-\\ning birth. Currently, it is believed that brucellosis can\\nalso be transmitted sexually.\\nThe disease is not usually fatal, but the intermittent\\nfevers (a source of its nickname, “undulant fever”) can be\\nexhausting. Symptoms usually appear between five days\\nand a month after exposure and begin with a single bout\\nof high fever accompanied by shivering, aching, and\\ndrenching sweats that last for a few days.

Turkington\\nBrugian filariasis see Elephantiasis\\nBruises\\nDefinition\\nBruises, or ecchymoses, are a discoloration and ten-\\nderness of the skin or mucous membranes due to the\\nleakage of blood from an injured blood vessel into the\\ntissues. Pupura refers to bruising as the result of a disease\\ncondition. A very small bruise is called a petechia. These\\noften appear as many tiny red dots clustered together,\\nand could indicate a serious problem.\\nDescription\\nBruises change colors over time in a predictable pat-\\ntern, so that it is possible to estimate when an injury\\noccurred by the color of the bruise. Initially, a bruise will\\nbe reddish, the color of the blood under the skin. After\\none to two days, the red blood cells begin to break down,\\nand the bruise will darken to a blue or purplish color.\\nThis fades to green at about day six. Around the eighth or\\nninth day, the skin over the bruised area will have a\\nbrown or yellowish appearance, and it will gradually\\ndiminish back to its normal color.\\nLong periods of standing will cause the blood that\\ncollects in a bruise to seep through the tissues. Bruises\\nare actually made of little pools of blood, so the blood in\\none place may flow downhill after awhile and appear in\\nanother. For instance, bruising in the back of the\\nabdomen may eventually appear in the groin; bruising in\\nthe thigh or the knee will work its way down to the ankle.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nHealthy people may develop bruises from any injury\\nthat doesn’t break through the skin. Vigorous exercise\\nmay also cause bruises due to bringing about small tears\\nin blood vessels walls. In a condition known as purpura\\nsimplex, there is a tendency to bruise easily due to an\\nincreased fragility of the blood vessels. Bruises also\\ndevelop easily in the elderly, because the skin and blood\\nvessels have a tendency to become thinner and more\\nfragile with aging, and there is an increased use of med-\\nications that interfere with the blood clotting system. In\\nthe condition known as purpura senilis, the elderly devel-\\nop bruises from minimal contact that may take up to sev-\\neral months to completely heal.\\nThe use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories such as\\nibuprofen (Advil) and naproxen (Aleve) may lead to\\nincreased bruising. Aspirin , antidepressants, asthma\\nmedications, and cortisone medications also have this\\neffect. The anti-clotting medications also known as blood\\nthinners, especially the drug Warfarin (Coumadin), may\\nbe the cause of particularly severe bruising.\\nSometimes bruises are connected with more serious\\nillnesses.

If there are large areas of bruis-\\ning or bruises develop very easily, this may herald a\\nproblem. Other causes that should be ruled out include\\nliver disease,alcoholism, drug addiction, and acquired\\nimmune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS). Bruising that\\noccurs around the navel may indicate dangerous internal\\nbleeding; bruising behind the ear, called Battle’s sign,\\nmay be due to a skull fracture; and raised bruises may\\npoint to autoimmune disease.\\nDiagnosis\\nBruising is usually a minor problem, which does not\\nrequire a medical diagnosis. However, faced with exten-\\nsive bruising, bruising with no apparent cause, or bruis-\\ning in certain locations, a physician will pursue an evalu-\\nation that will include a number of blood tests. If the area\\nof the bruise becomes hard, an x ray may be required.\\nTreatment\\nA bruise by itself needs no medical treatment. It is\\noften recommended that ice packs be applied on and off\\nduring the first 24 hours of injury to reduce the bruising.\\nAfter that, heat, especially moist heat, is recommended\\nto increase the circulation and the healing of the injured\\ntissues. Rest, elevation of the effected part, and compres-\\nsion with a bandage will also retard the accumulation of\\nblood. Rarely, if a bruise is so large that the body cannot\\ncompletely absorb it or if the site becomes infected, it\\nmay have to be surgically removed.\\nAlternative treatment\\nSeveral types of topical applications are usually rec-\\nommend to speed healing and to reduce the pain associ-\\nated with bruises. Vitamin K cream can be applied direct-\\nly to the site of injury. Astringent herbs such as witch\\nhazel,Hamamelis virginiana , can be used. This will\\ntighten the tissues and therefore diminish the bruising.\\nThe homeopathic remedy,Arnica montana , can be\\napplied as a cream or gel to unbroken skin.\\nOral homeopathic remedies may reduce bruising,\\npain, and swelling as well. Arnica montana , at 30 ml (1\\noz), taken one to two times per day is highly recom-\\nmended. For ledum, 30 ml (1 oz) one to two times per\\nday is also useful.\\nPrognosis\\nThe blood under the skin which causes the discol-\\noration of bruising should be totally reabsorbed by the\\nbody in three weeks or less. At that time, the skin color\\nshould completely return to normal.\\nSometimes, a bruise may become solid and increase\\nin size instead of dissolving. This may indicate blood\\ntrapped in the tissues, which may be need to be drained.\\nThis is referred to as a hematoma. Less commonly, the\\nbody may develop calcium deposits at the injury site in a\\nprocess called heterotopic ossification.\\nPrevention\\nVitamin K promotes normal clotting in the blood,\\nand therefore may help reduce the tendency to bruise\\neasily. Green leafy vegetables, alfalfa, broccoli, seaweed,\\nand fish liver oils are dietary sources of vitamin K. Other\\ngood foods to eat would be those containing\\nbioflavonoids, such as reddish-blue berries. These can\\nassist in strengthening the connective tissue, which will\\ndecrease the spread of blood and bruising.

Left untreat-\\ned, bruxism may lead to tooth loss and jaw dysfunction.\\nDiagnosis\\nMedical and dental histories and examinations are\\nnecessary to differentiate bruxism from other conditions\\nthat may cause similar pain, such as ear infections, dental\\ninfections, and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunc-\\ntion. However, uncommonly worn-down teeth strongly\\nsuggest a diagnosis of bruxism.\\nTreatment\\nTo prevent further damage to the teeth, bruxism is\\ntreated by placing a removable, custom-fitted plastic\\nappliance called a night guard between the upper and\\nlower teeth. Although the clenching and grinding behav-\\nior may continue, the teeth wear away the plastic instead\\nof each other.\\nIn some cases, abnormal occlusion may be adjusted\\nand high spots removed so that the teeth fit together in a\\nmore comfortable position.

The high pressure of blood in these veins\\nleads to an enlarged liver, and to an accumulation of fluid\\nin the abdomen, called ascites.\\nDescription\\nThe liver, the largest internal organ in the human\\nbody, is responsible for many vital physiologic process-\\nes. Blood flow through the liver nourishes the liver, car-\\nries in substances that the liver will process, and carries\\naway substances that the liver has produced. When blood\\ncannot flow out freely from the liver, blood pressure rises\\nin the veins of the liver, leading to blood clots within the\\nliver. Also, some of the blood plasma can leak through\\nthe walls of the veins and accumulate within the\\nabdomen (ascites).\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe major symptoms include pain in the upper\\nright-hand portion of the abdomen and a build-up of fluid\\nin the abdomen. In the United States, blood disorders are\\nthe most common causes. Among these disorders are\\npolycythemia rubra vera (an increase in the number of\\nred blood cells), and sickle cell disease . In parts of the\\nworld where liver cancer is common, a form of liver\\ncancer is the most frequent cause.\\nOther causes sometimes include:\\n• certain infections\\n• use of oral contraceptives\\n• body changes in pregnancy and the postpartum period\\n• phlebitis (inflammation of a vein)\\n• injury to the abdomen\\n• membranous webs (especially in Asia)\\nKEY TERMS\\nAscites—Accumulation of fluid in the abdomen.\\nBiopsy—Surgical removal of a tiny bit of tissue for\\nexamination under the microscope.\\nCatheter—A tubular surgical instrument.\\nPhlebitis—Inflammation of a vein.\\nPolycythemia rubra vera —An excess number of\\nred blood cells in the blood.\\nSickle cell disease—An inherited disease in which\\nred blood cells take an unusual shape, leading to\\ncirculation problems.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of Budd-Chiari syndrome can be made by\\nan internist (a specialist in diseases of the internal\\norgans), a gastroenterologist (a specialist in the diseases\\nof the digestive system), or a general surgeon. On physi-\\ncal examination , the doctor will note that the liver is\\nlarger than normal. Often an ultrasound scan of the liver\\nwill show abnormalities in the size of the liver, an abnor-\\nmal pattern of the veins in the liver, and other abnormali-\\nties. A CT scan will often show similar abnormalities.\\nOnce these abnormalities are confirmed, the key test\\nis called hepatic vein catheterization. In this test, a narrow\\ntube is snaked through the body until it reaches the hepat-\\nic veins. An instrument at the tip of the catheter can mea-\\nsure the pressure within each segment of the hepatic vein.\\nIn some cases, a tiny amount of radioactive material is\\ninjected into a patient, and then an abnormal pattern of\\nradioactivity in the liver can be revealed. In other cases, a\\nliver biopsyenables a physician to examine cells from the\\nliver itself. Cells damaged by Budd-Chiari syndrome have a\\ncharacteristic appearance easily identifiable to a physician.\\nTreatment\\nSurgery\\nMost patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome must\\nhave surgery. A surgeon will re-route blood flow around\\nthe clotted hepatic vein into a large vein called the vena\\ncava. The exact technique will depend on the specific\\nlocation of the clots and other factors. In certain patients,\\nother surgical techniques may be used. For patients who\\notherwise would have less than six months to live,liver\\ntransplantation is sometimes performed.\\nIn a few patients, a “balloon catheter” can open the\\nblocked blood vessels, without the need for major surgery.\\nDrugs\\nSometimes, anti-clotting drugs such as urokinase\\ncan be used for patients with a sudden onset of clotting in\\nthe veins of the liver. These drugs do not seem to work\\nwhen the clots have become established.\\nPrognosis\\nIf surgery is done before permanent liver damage sets\\nin, long-term survival is possible. In these cases, damaged\\nliver cells can actually recover. If patients are already very\\nsick with liver disease, the surgery may not be as helpful.\\nPrevention\\nThe best approach to prevention is to carefully control\\nthe blood disorders that can lead to Budd-Chiari syndrome.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2610\\nBudd-Chiari syndrome\\nGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 610'),\n",

Lampert\\nBuerger’s disease\\nDefinition\\nBuerger’s disease is an inflammation of the arteries,\\nveins, and nerves in the legs, principally, leading to\\nrestricted blood flow. Left untreated, Buerger’s disease\\ncan lead to gangrene of the affected areas. Buerger’s dis-\\nease is also known as thromboangitis obliterans.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe exact cause of Buerger’s disease is not known. It\\nis seen most often in young to middle-aged men (ages\\n20-40) who are heavy smokers of cigarettes. Cases of\\nthis disease in non-smokers are very rare, hence, ciga-\\nrette smoking is considered a causative factor. Approxi-\\nmately 40% of the patients have a history of inflamma-\\ntion of a vein (phlebitis), which may play a role in the\\ndevelopment of Buerger’s disease. The disease is mainly\\nseen in the legs of affected persons, but may also appear\\nin their arms. Early symptoms include decrease in the\\nblood supply (arterial ischemia) and superficial (near the\\nskin surface) phlebitis. The main symptom is pain in the\\naffected areas. Onset of the disease is gradual and first\\noccurs in the feet or hands. Inflammation occurs in small\\nand medium-sized arteries and veins near the surface of\\nthe limb. In advanced cases, blood vessels in other parts\\nof the body may be affected. There is a progressive\\ndecrease in the blood flow to the affected areas. The\\npulse in arteries of the feet is weak or undetectable. The\\nlack of blood flow can lead to gangrene, which is decay\\nof tissue due to restricted blood supply. A cold sensitivity\\nin the hands, similar to that seen in Raynaud’s disease,\\ncan develop. In this case, the hands turn color—white,\\nblue, and then red—when exposed to the cold.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is usually made from the clinical symp-\\ntoms. Patients frequently complain of numbness, tin-\\ngling, or burning sensations in the affected area before\\nevidence of vascular inflammation becomes apparent.\\nKEY TERMS\\nGangrene —A decay of the tissue in a part of the\\nbody that experiences restricted blood flow.\\nInflammation—A local reaction to irritation, injury,\\nor infection characterized by pain, swelling, red-\\nness, and occasional loss of function.\\nIschemia —A decrease in the blood supply to an\\narea of the body caused by obstruction or con-\\nstriction of blood vessels.\\nPhlebitis—Inflammation of a vein.\\nTreatment\\nThere is no effective medication or surgery for this\\ndisease. Patients must stop smoking to halt further devel-\\nopment of the symptoms. Vasodilators , drugs that\\nincrease the diameter of the blood vessels, can be admin-\\nistered, but may not be effective. Exposure of affected\\nareas to heat or cold should be avoided. Trauma to the\\nfeet and other affected areas should be avoided and infec-\\ntions must be treated promptly.\\nPrognosis\\nThe disease is progressive in patients who do not\\nstop smoking. Areas with gangrene must be removed sur-\\ngically.\\nPrevention\\nSmoking is the only known causative agent for this\\ndisease and should be avoided.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBerkow, R., ed.

People with bulimia, known as bulimics, consume\\nlarge amounts of food (binge) and then try to rid them-\\nselves of the food and calories (purge) by fasting, exces-\\nsive exercise, vomiting, or using laxatives. The behavior\\noften serves to reduce stress and relieve anxiety. Because\\nbulimia results from an excessive concern with weight\\ncontrol and self-image, and is often accompanied by\\ndepression, it is also considered a psychiatric illness.\\nDescription\\nBulimia nervosa is a serious health problem for over\\ntwo million adolescent girls and young women in the\\nUnited States. The bingeing and purging activity associ-\\nated with this disorder can cause severe damage, even\\ndeath, although the risk of death is not as high as for\\nanorexia nervosa, an eating disorder that leads to exces-\\nsive weight loss.\\nBinge eating may in rare instances cause the stom-\\nach to rupture. In the case of purging, heart failure can\\nresult due to loss of vital minerals such as potassium.\\nV omiting causes other serious problems, including acid-\\nrelated scarring of the fingers (if used to induce vomit-\\ning) and damage to tooth enamel. In addition, the tube\\nthat brings food from the mouth to the stomach (the\\nesophagus) often becomes inflamed and salivary glands\\ncan become swollen. Irregular menstrual periods can also\\nresult, and interest in sex may diminish.\\nMost bulimics find it difficult to stop their behavior\\nwithout professional help. Many typically recognize that\\nthe behavior is not normal, but feel out of control. Some\\nbulimics struggle with other compulsive, risky behaviors\\nsuch as drug and alcohol abuse. Many also suffer from\\nother psychiatric illnesses, including clinical depression,\\nanxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).\\nMost bulimics are females in their teens or early 20s.\\nMales account for only 5-10% of all cases. People of all\\nraces develop the disorder, but most of those diagnosed\\nare white.\\nBulimic behavior is often carried out in secrecy,\\naccompanied by feelings of guilt or shame. Outwardly,\\nmany people with bulimia appear healthy and successful,\\nwhile inside they have feelings of helplessness and low\\nself-esteem.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nThe cause of bulimia is unknown. Researchers\\nbelieve that it may be caused by a combination of genetic\\nand environmental factors. Bulimia tends to run in fami-\\nlies. Research shows that certain brain chemicals, known\\nas neurotransmitters, may function abnormally in acutely\\nill bulimia patients. Scientists also believe there may be a\\nlink between bulimia and other psychiatric problems,\\nsuch as depression and OCD. Environmental influences\\ninclude participation in work or sports that emphasize\\nthinness, such as modeling, dancing, or gymnastics. Fam-\\nily pressures also may play a role. One study found that\\nmothers who are extremely concerned about their daugh-\\nters’ physical attractiveness and weight may help to cause\\nbulimia. In addition, girls with eating disorders tend to\\nhave fathers and brothers who criticize their weight.\\nSymptoms\\nAccording to the American Anorexia/Bulimia Asso-\\nciation, Inc., warning signs of bulimia include:\\n• eating large amounts of food uncontrollably (bingeing)\\n• vomiting, abusing laxatives or diuretics, or engaging in\\nfasting, dieting, or vigorous exercise (purging)\\n• preoccupation with body weight\\n• using the bathroom frequently after meals\\n• depression or mood swings\\n• irregular menstrual periods\\n• onset of dental problems, swollen cheeks or glands,\\nheartburn or bloating\\nDiagnosis\\nBulimia is treated most successfully when diag-\\nnosed early. But because the bulimic may deny there is a\\nproblem, getting medical help is often delayed. A com-\\nplete physical examination in order to rule out other ill-\\nnesses is the first step to diagnosis.\\nAccording to the American Psychiatric Association,\\na diagnosis of bulimia requires that a person have all of\\nthe following symptoms:\\n• recurrent episodes of binge eating (minimum average\\nof two binge-eating episodes a week for at least three\\nmonths)\\n• a feeling of lack of control over eating during the\\nbinges\\n• regular use of one or more of the following to prevent\\nweight gain: self-induced vomiting, use of laxatives or\\ndiuretics, strict dieting or fasting, or vigorous exercise\\n• persistent over-concern with body shape and weight\\nTreatment\\nEarly treatment is important otherwise bulimia may\\nbecome chronic, with serious health consequences.

The right\\nbundle carries nerve impulses that cause contraction of the\\nright ventricle (the lower chamber of the heart) and the left\\nbundle carries nerve impulses that cause contraction of the\\nleft ventricle. The two bundles initially are together at a\\njunction called the bundle of His. Nerve impulses come\\nthrough the sinus node of the heart to the bundle of His\\nand then move into the right and left bundle branches.\\nBundle branch block is a slowing or interruption of nerve\\nimpulses. A problem may exist in any of the three bundles.\\nPatients with BBB are generally without symptoms\\nunless the disease is severe enough to cause a complete\\ninfranodal A-V block and very slow heart rate. In patients\\nwith right bundle branch block (RBBB), the nerve impulse\\nis conducted slowly or not at all. The right ventricle finally\\nreceives the impulse through muscle-to-muscle spread,\\noutside the regular nerve pathway. This mechanism of\\nimpulse transmission is slow and results in a delayed con-\\ntraction of the right ventricle. There are several types of\\nleft bundle branch block (LBBB), each producing its own\\ncharacteristic mechanism of failure. In each case, the\\nnerve impulse is blocked or delayed. Patients with LBBB\\nmay have left ventricular disease or cardiomyopathy.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nLeft bundle branch block usually happens as a con-\\nsequence of other diseases such as arteriosclerosis,\\nrheumatic fever, congenital heart disease , myocardi-\\ntis, myocardial infarction, metastatic heart tumors, or\\nother invasions of the heart tissue. Right bundle branch\\nblock happens less often from underlying heart disease.\\nDiagnosis\\nDetection of BBB usually takes place during a nor-\\nmal physical examination .

The swelling in the joint causes\\nadditional pain and pressure in the toe.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nBunions may form as a result of abnormal motion of\\nthe foot during walking or running. One common exam-\\nple of an abnormal movement is an excessive amount of\\nstressplaced upon the inside of the foot. This leads to\\nfriction and irritation of the involved structures. Age has\\nalso been noted as a factor in developing bunions, in part\\nbecause the underlying bone displacement worsens over\\ntime unless corrective measures are taken.\\nWearing improperly fitting shoes, especially those\\nwith a narrow toe box and excessive heel height, often\\ncauses the formation of a bunion. This forefoot deformity\\nis seen more often in women than men. The higher fre-\\nquency in females may be related to the strong link\\nbetween footwear fashion and bunions. In fact, in a\\nrecent survey of more than 350 women, nearly 90% wore\\nshoes that were at least one size too small or too narrow.\\nBecause genetic factors can predispose people to the\\nhallux valgus bone displacement, a strong family history\\nof bunions can increase the likelihood of developing this\\nfoot disorder. Various arthritic conditions and several\\ngenetic and neuromuscular diseases, such as Down syn-\\ndrome and Marfan syndrome , cause muscle imbal-\\nances that can create bunions from displacement of the\\nfirst metatarsal and big toe. Other possible causes of\\nbunions are leg-length discrepancies, with the bunion\\npresent on the longer leg, and trauma occurring to the\\njoint of the big toe.\\nSymptoms of bunions include the common signs of\\ninflammation such as redness, swelling, and pain. The\\ndiscomfort is primarily located along the inside of the\\nfoot just behind the big toe. Because of friction, a callus\\nmay develop over the bunion. If an overlapping of the\\ntoes is allowed, additional rubbing and pain occurs.\\nInflammation of this area causes a decrease in motion\\nwith associated discomfort in the joint between the big\\ntoe and the first metatarsal. If allowed to worsen, the skin\\nover the bunion may break down causing an ulcer, which\\nalso presents a problem of potential infection. (Foot\\nulcers can be particularly dangerous for people with dia-\\nbetes, who may have trouble feeling the ulcer forming\\nand healing if it becomes infected.)\\nDiagnosis\\nA thorough medical history and physical exam by a\\nphysician is always necessary for the proper diagnosis of\\nbunions and other foot conditions. X rays can help con-\\nfirm the diagnosis by showing the bone displacement,\\njoint swelling, and, in some cases, the overgrowth of\\nbone that characterizes bunions. Doctors will also con-\\nsider the possibility that the joint pain is caused by or\\ncomplicated by arthritis (which causes destruction of the\\ncartilage of the joint),gout (which causes the accumula-\\ntion of uric acid crystals in the joint), tiny fractures of a\\nbone in the foot (stress fractures), or infection and may\\norder additional tests to rule out these possibilities.\\nTreatment\\nConservative\\nThe first step in treating a bunion is to remove as\\nmuch pressure from the area as possible. People with\\nbunions should wear shoes that have enough room in the\\ntoe box to accommodate the bunion and avoid high-heeled\\nshoes and tight-fitting socks or stockings. Dressings and\\npads help protect the bunion from additional shoe pres-\\nsure. The application of splints or customized shoe inserts\\n(orthotics) to correct the alignment of the big toe joint is\\neffective for many bunions.

This procedure is called a bunionectomy, and\\nthere are many variations on the operation, which is usu-\\nally performed by a surgeon who specializes in treating\\nbone conditions (orthopedics) or by one who specializes\\nin treating the foot (podiatry). Surgeons consider the\\nangle of the bone misalignment, the condition of the\\nbursa, and the strength of the bones when they choose\\nwhich procedure to use. Most bunionectomies involve\\nthe removal of a section of bone and the insertion of pins\\nto rejoin the bone. Sometimes the surgeons may move\\nligaments (which connect bone to bone in the joint) or\\ntendons (which connect bone to muscle) in order to\\nrealign the bones. After this procedure, the bones and\\nother tissues are held in place while they heal by com-\\npression dressings or a short cast. The individual must\\nrefrain from vigorous exercise for six weeks.\\nAlternative treatment\\nDeep friction massage techniques by a physical or\\nmassage therapist can be helpful to increase circulation,\\nreduce inflammation, and prevent soft tissue build up.\\nPhysical therapy also provides useful approaches such as\\nultrasound to help retard or reverse the formation of the\\nbunion. Various taping techniques can be useful to\\nrealign the toe and decrease friction and rubbing that\\nmay be present.

This rule\\ncannot be applied to a young child’s body proportions, so\\nBSA is estimated using the palm of the patient’s hand as\\na measure of 1% area.\\nThe severity of the burn will determine not only the\\ntype of treatment, but also where the burn patient should\\nreceive treatment. Minor burns may be treated at home or\\nin a doctor’s office.

Extensive burns may\\ninduce shock, the symptoms of which are faintness,\\nweakness, rapid pulse and breathing, pale and clammy\\nskin, and bluish lips and fingernails.\\nDiagnosis\\nA physician will diagnose a burn based upon visual\\nexamination, and will also ask the patient or family mem-\\nbers questions to determine the best treatment. He or she\\nmay also check for smoke inhalation,carbon monoxide\\npoisoning, cyanide poisoning, other event-related trau-\\nma, or, if suspected, further evidence of child abuse.\\nTreatment\\nBurn treatment consists of relieving pain, preventing\\ninfection, and maintaining body fluids, electrolytes, and\\ncalorie intake while the body heals. Treatment of chemi-\\ncal or electrical burns is slightly different from the treat-\\nment of thermal burns but the objectives are the same.\\nThermal burn treatment\\nThe first act of thermal burn treatment is to stop the\\nburning process. This may be accomplished by letting cool\\nwater run over the burned area or by soaking it in cool (not\\ncold) water. Ice should never be applied to the burn. Cool\\n(not cold) wet compresses may provide some pain relief\\nwhen applied to small areas of first- and second-degree\\nburns. Butter, shortening, or similar salve should never be\\napplied to the burn since it prevents heat from escaping\\nand drives the burning process deeper into the skin.\\nIf the burn is minor, it may be cleaned gently with\\nsoap and water. Blisters should not be broken. If the skin\\nof the burned area is unbroken and it is not likely to be\\nfurther irritated by pressure or friction, the burn should\\nbe left exposed to the air to promote healing. If the skin\\nis broken or apt to be disturbed, the burned area should\\nbe coated lightly with an antibacterial ointment and cov-\\nered with a sterile bandage. Aspirin , acetaminophen\\n(Tylenol), or ibuprofen (Advil) may be taken to ease pain\\nand relieve inflammation. A doctor should be consulted\\nif these signs of infection appear: increased warmth, red-\\nness, pain, or swelling; pus or similar drainage from the\\nwound; swollen lymph nodes; or red streaks spreading\\naway from the burn.\\nIn situations where a person has received moderate or\\ncritical burns, lifesaving measures take precedence over\\nburn treatment and emergency medical assistance must be\\ncalled. A person with serious burns may stop breathing,\\nand artificial respiration (also called mouth-to-mouth\\nresuscitation or rescue breathing) should be administered\\nimmediately. Also, a person with burns covering more\\nthan 12% BSA is likely to go into shock; this condition\\nmay be prevented by laying the person flat and elevating\\nthe feet about 12 in (30 cm). Burned arms and hands\\nshould also be raised higher than the person’s heart.\\nIn rescues, a blanket may be used to smother any\\nflames as the person is removed from danger. The person\\nwhose clothing is on fire should “stop, drop, and roll” or\\nbe assisted in lying flat on the ground and rolling to put\\nout the fire. Afterwards, only burnt clothing that comes\\noff easily should be removed; any clothing embedded in\\nthe burn should not be disturbed. Removing any smol-\\ndering apparel and covering the person with a light, cool,\\nwet cloth, such as a sheet but not a blanket or towel, will\\nstop the burning process.\\nAt the hospital, the staff will provide further med-\\nical treatment. A tube to aid breathing may be inserted if\\nthe patient’s airways or lungs have been damaged, as\\ncan happen during an explosion or a fire in a enclosed\\nspace. Also, because burns dramatically deplete the\\nbody of fluids, replacement fluids are administered\\nintravenously. The patient is also given antibiotics intra-\\nvenously to prevent infection, and he or she may also\\nreceive a tetanus shot, depending on his or her immu-\\nnization history. Once the burned area is cleaned and\\ntreated with antibiotic cream or ointment, it is covered\\nin sterile bandages, which are changed two to three\\ntimes a day. Surgical removal of dead tissue (debride-\\nment) also takes place.

Bursae\\ncushion the movement between the bones, tendons and\\nmuscles near the joints. Bursitis is most often caused by\\nrepetitive movement and is known by several common\\nnames including weaver’s bottom, clergyman’s knee, and\\nminer’s elbow, depending on the affected individual’s\\noccupation and area of injury.\\nDescription\\nThere are over 150 bursae in the human body. Usual-\\nly bursae are present from birth, but they may form in\\nresponse to repeated pressure. Each sac contains a small\\namount of synovial fluid, a clear liquid that acts as a\\nlubricant. Inflammation causes pain on movement. The\\nmost common site for bursitis to occur is the shoulder\\n(subdeltoid), but it also is seen in the elbows (olecranon),\\nhips (trochanteric), knees, heels (Achilles), and toes. The\\naffected area may be referred to as “frozen,” because\\nmovement is so limited. In the knee there are four bursae,\\nand all can become inflamed with overuse.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe most common cause of bursitis is repeated\\nphysical activity, but it can flare up for no known reason.\\nIt can also be caused by trauma,rheumatoid arthritis ,\\ngout, and acute or chronic infection.\\nPain and tenderness are common symptoms. If the\\naffected joint is close to the skin, as with the shoulder,\\nknee, elbow, or Achilles tendon, swelling and redness are\\nseen and the area may feel warm to the touch. The bursae\\naround the hip joint are deeper, and swelling is not obvi-\\nous. Movement may be limited and is painful. In the\\nshoulder, it may be difficult to raise the arm out from the\\nside of the body. Putting on a jacket or combing the hair\\nbecomes a troublesome activity.\\nIn acute bursitis symptoms appear suddenly; with\\nchronic bursitis, pain, tenderness, and limited movement\\nreappear after exercise or strain.\\nDiagnosis\\nWhen a patient has pain in a joint, a careful physical\\nexamination is needed to determine what type of move-\\nment is affected and if there is any swelling present. Bur-\\nsitis will not show up on x-rays, although sometimes\\nthere are also calcium deposits in the joint that can be\\nseen. Inserting a thin needle into the affected bursa and\\nremoving (aspirating) some of the synovial fluid for\\nexamination can confirm the diagnosis. In most cases,\\nthe fluid will not be clear. It can be tested for the pres-\\nence of microorganisms, which would indicate an infec-\\ntion, and crystals, which could indicate gout. In instances\\nwhere the diagnosis is difficult, a local anesthetic (a drug\\nthat numbs the area) is injected into the painful spot. If\\nthe discomfort stops temporarily, then bursitis is proba-\\nbly the correct diagnosis.\\nTreatment\\nConservative treatment of bursitis is usually effec-\\ntive.

Once the pain decreases,\\nexercises of the affected area can begin. If the nearby\\nmuscles have become weak because of the disease or\\nprolonged immobility, then exercises to build strength\\nand improve movement are best. A doctor or physical\\ntherapist can prescribe an effective regimen.\\nIf the bursitis is related to an inflammatory condition\\nlike arthritis or gout, then management of that disease is\\nneeded to control the bursitis.\\nWhen bursitis does not respond to conservative\\ntreatment, an injection into the joint of a long-acting cor-\\nticosteroid preparation, like prednisone, can bring imme-\\ndiate and lasting relief. A corticosteroid is a hormonal\\nsubstance that is the most effective drug for reducing\\ninflammation. The drug is mixed with a local anesthetic\\nand works on the joint within five minutes. Usually one\\ninjection is all that is needed.\\nSurgery to remove the damaged bursa may be per-\\nformed in extreme cases.\\nIf the bursitis is caused by an infection, then addi-\\ntional treatment is needed. Septic bursitis is caused by the\\npresence of a pus-forming organism, usually staphylococ-\\ncus aureus. This is confirmed by examining a sample of\\nthe fluid in the bursa and requires treatment with antibi-\\notics taken by mouth, injected into a muscle or into a vein\\n(intravenously). The bursa will also need to be drained by\\nneedle two or three times over the first week of treatment.\\nWhen a patient has such a serious infection, there may be\\nunderlying causes. There could be undiscovered diabetes,\\nor an inefficient immune system caused by human\\nimmunodeficiencyvirus infection (HIV).\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative treatments take into consideration the\\nrole of diet in causing bursitis. The faulty use of calcium\\nby the body, magnesium deficiency, and food allergies\\nmay have a role. Diet changes and vitamin supplements\\nmay be helpful. The use of herbs,homeopathy , aro-\\nmatherapy , and hydrotherapy can help relieve symp-\\ntoms.

More than\\n800,000 workers in the cotton, flax, and rope-making\\nindustries are exposed in the workplace to airborne parti-\\ncles that can cause byssinosis. Only workers in mills that\\nmanufacture yarn, thread, or fabric have a significant risk\\nof dying of this disease.\\nIn the United States, byssinosis is almost completely\\nlimited to workers who handle unprocessed cotton. More\\nthan 35,000 textile workers have been disabled by byssi-\\nnosis and 183 died between 1979 and 1992. Most of the\\npeople whose deaths were due to byssinosis lived in the\\ntextile-producing regions of North and South Carolina.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nWheezing , shortness of breath , and a feeling of\\ntightness in the chest occur occasionally during the early\\nstages of the disease. Symptoms are usually more pro-\\nnounced when returning to work after a weekend, holi-\\nday, or vacation and subside as the worker becomes reac-\\ncustomed to the environment.\\nAs many as 25% of workers with byssinosis have\\nsymptoms that continue or recur throughout the work-\\nweek. More severe breathing problems seem to result\\nboth from exposure to high levels of dust and from\\nlonger dust exposure. Workers who also smoke cigarettes\\nsuffer the most severe impairment.\\nDiagnosis\\nTests that detect decreasing lung capacity during the\\nworkday are used to diagnose byssinosis. Obstructive\\npatterns are likely in patients who have had recurrent\\nsymptoms for more than 10 years.\\nTreatment\\nTherapy for early-stage byssinosis focuses on\\nreversing airway narrowing. Antihistamines may be pre-\\nscribed to reduce tightness in the chest. Bronchodilators\\n(drugs used to relax breathing passages and improve air\\nflow) may be used with an inhaler or taken in tablet form.\\nReducing exposure is essential. Any worker who has\\nsymptoms of byssinosis or who has trouble breathing\\nshould transfer to a less-contaminated area.\\nPrognosis\\nSmoking, impaired lung function, and a history of\\nrespiratory allergy increase a textile worker’s risk of devel-\\noping byssinosis. Prolonged exposure makes patients\\nwheeze more often and can cause chronic bronchitis. It\\ndoes not lead to permanently disabling lung disease.\\nPrevention\\nEliminating exposure to textile dust is the surest way\\nto prevent byssinosis. Using exhaust hoods, improving\\nventilation, and employing wetting procedures are very\\nsuccessful methods of controlling dust levels to prevent\\nbyssinosis. Protective equipment required during certain\\nprocedures also prevents exposure to levels of contami-\\nnation that exceed the current United States standard for\\ncotton dust exposure.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nHarrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine.Ed.

      "Okay, so I need to figure out what Achalasia is. I remember hearing the term before, but I'm not exactly sure what it entails. Let me start by breaking down the word. \"Achalasia\" sounds Greek, and I think \"chalia\" means something like \"to let go\" or \"to relax.\" So maybe \"Achalasia\" means \"failure to relax.\" That makes sense because I think it's related to muscles not relaxing properly.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the document, I see that Achalasia is a disorder of the esophagus. The esophagus is the tube that carries food from the throat to the stomach. So if Achalasia affects this, it probably has something to do with how food moves down the esophagus.\n",
      "\n",
      "The document mentions that the lower esophageal sphincter doesn't relax properly. The sphincter is a ring of muscle that acts like a valve. Normally, when you swallow, this sphincter relaxes to let food into the stomach and then tightens again. In Achalasia, this doesn't happen correctly, so food can't pass through easily.\n",
      "\n",
      "Symptoms include difficulty swallowing both solids and liquids, which is called dysphagia. There's also chest pain that might be mistaken for heart-related pain. Other symptoms are heartburn and trouble belching. These symptoms get worse over time, which suggests that the condition progresses.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cause isn't well understood, but it's thought to be related to autoimmune issues or infections. Autoimmune diseases happen when the body's immune system attacks its own tissues, so maybe in Achalasia, the immune system is attacking the esophageal muscles. Hidden infections could be another factor, but I'm not sure which infections are linked to this condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Diagnosis involves several tests. The first step is a medical history to understand the symptoms and their progression. Then, specific tests are used. Esophageal manometry is mentioned, which measures the pressure in the esophagus. This test can show if the sphincter isn't relaxing properly. An endoscopy is another test where a scope is inserted to visually inspect the esophagus and stomach. A barium swallow is an imaging test where the patient drinks a barium solution, and X-rays are taken to see how the esophagus functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment options include medications, dilation, and surgery. Medications like calcium channel blockers and nitrates help relax the sphincter. Dilation involves using a balloon to stretch the sphincter, making it easier for food to pass. Surgery, specifically a Heller myotomy, is a more invasive option where the sphincter muscles are cut to allow easier passage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Complications can arise if the condition isn't treated. Malnutrition is a risk because difficulty swallowing can lead to inadequate food intake. Aspiration pneumonia happens when food or liquid enters the lungs, which can be dangerous. Weight loss is another complication due to the difficulty in eating.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of management, patients are advised to eat slowly, chew thoroughly, and avoid lying down after eating to reduce the risk of aspiration. These lifestyle changes can help manage symptoms but aren't a cure.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider the ICD code for Achalasia, which is K59.4. This is important for medical records and insurance purposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, Achalasia is a condition where the lower esophageal sphincter doesn't relax properly, leading to difficulty swallowing and other symptoms. It's diagnosed through specific tests and managed with a combination of medications, procedures, and lifestyle changes. It's important for patients to consult healthcare professionals for accurate diagnosis and treatment.\n",

      "Okay, so I need to figure out how to diagnose achalasia. I remember that achalasia is a condition affecting the esophagus, but I'm not exactly sure about the specifics. Let me start by recalling what I know about achalasia. It has something to do with difficulty swallowing, right? I think it's related to the muscles in the esophagus not working properly.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the document provided, I see that symptoms include dysphagia, which is difficulty swallowing both solids and liquids. There's also mention of chest pain that can be mistaken for heart-related pain. Other symptoms might include regurgitation, weight loss, and nighttime cough or recurrent pneumonia due to food entering the airways.\n",
      "\n",
      "The diagnosis process begins with a careful medical history. The doctor would look into the timing of symptoms and try to rule out other conditions that cause similar symptoms. So, the first step is taking a detailed patient history to understand the progression of symptoms and eliminate other possibilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, the document mentions several tests used for diagnosis. The first is esophageal manometry. I think this involves inserting a thin tube into the esophagus to measure the pressure exerted by the esophageal sphincter. This test would help assess how well the muscles are functioning. If the sphincter isn't relaxing properly, that could indicate achalasia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another test mentioned is the barium swallow study. In this procedure, the patient drinks a barium solution, and X-rays are taken to observe how the esophagus moves. This can show if there's a lack of peristalsis, which is the wave-like movement that pushes food down the esophagus. If the esophagus doesn't move properly, it might point towards achalasia.\n",
      "\n",
      "The document also briefly touches on endoscopy, where a scope is used to examine the esophagus and stomach. This can help rule out other conditions like GERD or esophageal cancer, which might present with similar symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm also thinking about other possible tests. I've heard of something called a timed barium esophagram, where the patient swallows barium and the time it takes for it to pass into the stomach is measured. Prolonged transit time could be another indicator.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of medical guidelines, I believe the Rome criteria are used for diagnosing esophageal motility disorders. These criteria likely include symptoms and specific manometric findings. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code for achalasia is ICD-10 K59.0, which is important for medical records and insurance purposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting this all together, the diagnostic process for achalasia involves a combination of patient history, physical examination, and specific tests. The key is to rule out other conditions that can cause similar symptoms, such as GERD, esophageal cancer, or motility disorders.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider the importance of each test. Esophageal manometry is crucial because it directly measures the pressure in the esophagus and can show the characteristic findings of achalasia, like aperistalsis and failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax. The barium swallow helps visualize the structure and movement of the esophagus, which can show dilation and impaired motility.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's also important to note that while these tests are essential, the diagnosis isn't just about the test results but also the clinical picture. The patient's symptoms, such as progressive dysphagia and regurgitation, are significant clues.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder if there are any other tests or considerations. Maybe a 24-hour pH monitoring could be used to check for acid reflux, but that's more for GERD. Since achalasia is a motility disorder, the focus is more on the mechanical function of the esophagus.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the steps to diagnose achalasia would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Take a detailed medical history focusing on swallowing difficulties, chest pain, and other symptoms.\n",
      "2. Perform a physical examination to check for signs like weight loss or regurgitation.\n",
      "3. Conduct esophageal manometry to assess muscle function and sphincter relaxation.\n",
      "4. Perform a barium swallow study to visualize esophageal movement and structure.\n",
      "5. Possibly use endoscopy to rule out other conditions and examine the esophageal lining.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each of these steps helps build a comprehensive picture to confirm the diagnosis. It's also important to refer to medical guidelines like the Rome criteria to ensure that the diagnosis meets established standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also remember to mention that while these tests are important, they should be interpreted by a healthcare professional. Self-diagnosis isn't reliable, and only a qualified doctor can make an accurate diagnosis after reviewing all the information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing to consider is the importance of ruling out other conditions. For example, GERD can cause similar symptoms, so tests like pH monitoring might be done to differentiate. Additionally, esophageal cancer could present with dysphagia, so endoscopy is crucial to rule that out.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I've covered the main points. The diagnosis of achalasia requires a combination of clinical evaluation and specific diagnostic tests to confirm the condition and rule out other possibilities.\n",

      "Okay, so I need to figure out what a breech birth is. I remember hearing the term before, but I'm not exactly sure what it entails. Let me start by breaking down the word. \"Breech\" sounds like it might relate to the position of the baby during birth. \n",
      "\n",
      "From what I recall, most babies are born head-first. So, a breech birth must be when the baby is in a different position. Maybe the baby is coming out feet or bottom first instead of head first. That makes sense because the document mentioned that it's the delivery of a fetus hind end first. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think the document said that between 3-4% of fetuses start labor in the breech position. That's a small percentage, but it's still significant enough that it's a known issue. I wonder why some babies end up in this position. The document mentioned that between 32-36 weeks, the fetus becomes too large to move around as freely, so maybe they get stuck in the breech position. \n",
      "\n",
      "There are different types of breech positions, right? I think the document listed three: frank, complete, and footling. Frank breech is when the baby's buttocks are down and the legs are up. Complete breech is when the baby's knees are bent and the hips are flexed. Footling breech is when one or both feet come out first. I should make sure to explain each type clearly because understanding the differences might help in discussing the risks and management options.\n",
      "\n",
      "The document also talked about the risks involved. Breech births can lead to complications like umbilical cord prolapse, which is when the cord gets compressed, reducing oxygen to the baby. That sounds dangerous. There's also an increased risk of birth injuries, which could affect the baby's health. \n",
      "\n",
      "Management options were mentioned too. The document discussed cesarean sections as a common approach because it's safer for the baby. However, some women prefer trying to deliver vaginally, which carries more risks. There's also external cephalic version, where the doctor tries to turn the baby into a head-first position. The success rate is over 50%, but there's a chance the baby might turn back. \n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider the statistics. Since only 3-4% of babies are in breech position at term, it's not a common occurrence, but it's important to know about because of the potential risks. \n",
      "\n",
      "I need to make sure I explain this in simple terms, avoiding too much medical jargon. Maybe start with a definition, then explain the types, followed by the risks, and then the management options. Including the statistics will give a clearer picture of how common it is. \n",
      "\n",
      "I should also mention that while the document provides some information, it's crucial for expectant mothers to consult their healthcare providers for personalized advice. They can offer the most accurate and up-to-date information based on the individual's situation. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the document also mentioned that version is gaining popularity. So, external cephalic version is a procedure where the doctor tries to manually turn the baby. It's successful more than half the time, but there's a chance the baby might flip back. That's important because it gives women an option besides a cesarean section. \n",
      "\n",
      "I should structure the response to first define breech birth, then describe the types, outline the risks, discuss management options, and end with a note about consulting healthcare providers. Using bullet points for the types and management options will make it easier to read. \n",

      "Okay, so I need to figure out the causes and symptoms of an aortic aneurysm. Let me start by recalling what I know. An aortic aneurysm is a bulge in the aorta, which is the main artery carrying blood from the heart to the rest of the body. I remember that it's related to the aorta weakening, but I'm not entirely sure about the specifics.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the document, I see that aortic aneurysms are usually due to arteriosclerosis or atherosclerosis. Arteriosclerosis is the hardening of the arteries, while atherosclerosis is the buildup of plaque, which is made mostly of cholesterol. So, as people age, the aorta's walls can weaken, leading to an aneurysm. That makes sense because the document mentions that people between 50-80 are most likely to develop it, and men are more prone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another cause mentioned is a breakdown of the muscular middle layer of the artery wall. I think this refers to the tunica media, which is crucial for the artery's strength. If this layer breaks down, the wall becomes weaker, making an aneurysm more likely.\n",
      "\n",
      "High blood pressure is also a factor. Hypertension can stress the artery walls, making them more susceptible to bulging. So, uncontrolled high blood pressure increases the risk of an aortic aneurysm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, about symptoms. The document says that aortic aneurysms rarely produce symptoms and are often found incidentally during other tests. However, if the aneurysm is large or about to rupture, symptoms can appear. For abdominal aortic aneurysms, symptoms might include deep, constant abdominal pain, which can be severe. Back pain is also mentioned, which could be a sign of a rupturing aneurysm. In such cases, immediate medical attention is crucial.\n",
      "\n",
      "For thoracic aortic aneurysms, symptoms might involve chest pain, shortness of breath, difficulty swallowing, or a whooshing sound in the chest due to the turbulent blood flow. These symptoms can be subtle and might be mistaken for other conditions, leading to delayed diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also consider the risk factors. Age, gender, smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and a family history of aneurysms all increase the likelihood. These factors contribute to the weakening of the aorta's walls over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of diagnosis, the document mentions that aneurysms are often found during routine exams or imaging for other reasons. Tests like ultrasound, CT scans, or MRIs are used to detect and monitor the size of the aneurysm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment options depend on the size and location. Small aneurysms might just be monitored with regular check-ups. Larger ones or those causing symptoms might require surgery, such as open repair or endovascular stent grafting. Managing risk factors like controlling blood pressure and cholesterol is also part of the treatment plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also remember to mention that while the document provides good information, it's not a substitute for professional medical advice. Always consult a healthcare provider for personal concerns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I should make sure I'm not mixing up aortic aneurysms with aortic valve stenosis. The document also talks about aortic valve stenosis, which is a narrowing of the valve, but that's a different condition. So, I need to focus solely on aneurysms for this question.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the causes are mainly related to atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, weakening of the artery walls, and high blood pressure. Symptoms are rare but can include pain and other issues if the aneurysm is large or ruptures. Diagnosis and treatment involve imaging and possibly surgery, depending on the severity.\n",
