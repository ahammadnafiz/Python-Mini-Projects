# Auctra: Blockchain-Based Public Procurement System

_Transforming Government Tendering Through Transparent Auction Trajectories_

## Executive Summary

Auctra is a cutting-edge blockchain solution aimed at transforming the public procurement system in Bangladesh. It combines secure auction methods with clear tracking of processes to tackle issues like corruption, inefficiency, and lack of transparency, especially in infrastructure projects.

Bangladesh's public procurement system, which manages billions in government funds, faces major problems like corruption, inefficiency, and lack of clarity. These issues include manipulating project budgets, document fraud, and unfair practices in selecting contractors. This leads to the wrong use of public money and slows down the country's development. The World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Index 2020 points out these problems, ranking Bangladesh 168th out of 190 economies, with poor performance in government contracting.

Auctra offers a complete blockchain platform that changes the entire procurement process. Using smart contracts, unchangeable records, and automated checks, it ensures clear budget allocation, secure document checks, and fair contractor selection. The system's tracking feature allows real-time monitoring of procurement activities.

Using Auctra brings several benefits: less corruption through clear processes, big cost savings, more competition through fair access, and better trust in government institutions. Early estimates suggest it could save 15-20% in public procurement costs and cut processing time by up to 60%.

## Background

### Background: Economic Context

Bangladesh has seen impressive economic growth, with an average GDP growth rate of over 6% annually for the past decade. This growth has been supported by several key factors:

- **Lower Middle-Income Status**: Bangladesh became a lower middle-income country in 2015.
- **Infrastructure Development**: There has been a big increase in infrastructure investment, with annual spending rising by 15.5% according to the Planning Commission.
- **Resilience Amid Challenges**: The economy has remained strong despite global challenges, with growth expected to slow to 5.2% for FY24 due to weak consumption and exports.

### Current State of Public Procurement

The public procurement sector in Bangladesh is large, making up about 70% of the country's development budget and spending over $18 billion annually. However, it faces several issues:

- **Bureaucratic Complexity**: The sector involves complex processes with many government agencies.
- **Manual Systems**: Most documentation is manual and can be easily manipulated.
- **Lack of Standardization**: There are no standard pricing mechanisms.
- **Transparency Issues**: Limited transparency in selecting contractors leads to high levels of corruption and inefficiency.

### Market Size and Economic Impact

The public procurement market in Bangladesh is significant and has great growth potential:

| Category                     | Value (2023) | Growth Rate |
|------------------------------|--------------|-------------|
| Total Procurement Budget    | $18B          | 12%         |
| Infrastructure Projects      | $7.2B        | 15%         |
| Annual Tenders Processed     | 35,000+      | 8%          |
| Registered Contractors       | 12,000+      | 5%          |

This data shows the major economic impact of the public procurement sector, which is vital for supporting infrastructure development and other essential services in the country.

## Problem Statement
The process of awarding government contracts in Bangladesh, especially for large infrastructure projects, is plagued by corruption, inefficiency, and a lack of transparency. Common problems include manipulating project budgets, document fraud, and unfair practices in choosing contractors. These issues make the projects less effective, waste public resources, and hinder Bangladesh's progress towards its economic and social development goals, as outlined by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

## Problem Analysis

### Detailed Breakdown of Current Issues

1. **Tender Process Manipulation**

   - Budget inflation by government engineers (15-20% average markup)
   - Collusion between contractors and officials
   - Falsification of experience certificates
   - Arbitrary disqualification of eligible bidders

2. **Documentation and Verification**

   - Manual document processing leading to errors and delays
   - Lack of centralized verification system
   - Multiple redundant submissions across agencies
   - High cost of document management and storage

3. **Monitoring and Compliance**
   - Insufficient tracking of tender progress
   - Limited ability to detect fraudulent activities
   - Weak enforcement of compliance requirements
   - Lack of real-time reporting mechanisms

### Impact on Stakeholders

| Stakeholder | Impact                                       | Economic Cost           |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Government  | Budget overruns, Project delays              | 12-15% of project value |
| Contractors | Unfair competition, High compliance costs    | 8-10% of bid value      |
| Citizens    | Substandard infrastructure, Wasted tax money | Est. $1.2B annually     |
| Economy     | Reduced FDI, Lower growth potential          | 1.2% of GDP             |

### Economic Implications

The current system's inefficiencies create substantial economic burden:

- Direct financial losses: $1.5B annually through corruption
- Indirect costs: $2.3B in project delays and inefficiencies
- Lost FDI opportunities: Estimated $3.2B annually
- Administrative overhead: 15% of tender value

### UN SDG Alignment Gaps

Current system deficiencies impact multiple SDGs:

- SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, Infrastructure): Delayed infrastructure development
- SDG 16 (Peace, Justice, Strong Institutions): Weak institutional frameworks
- SDG 17 (Partnerships for Goals): Limited public-private collaboration
