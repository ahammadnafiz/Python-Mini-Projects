# ConvertirseAI: Advanced Code Conversion Platform

ConvertirseAI is an advanced code conversion platform powered by LLaMA3 70b, Langchain, and Groq API. It leverages state-of-the-art AI to transform code between various programming languages while maintaining code structure and functionality.

## Features

- **Code Conversion**: Convert code snippets from one programming language to another using advanced AI models.
- **Syntax Preservation**: Preserve comments and structure during code conversion.
- **Language Support**: Currently supports Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, Ruby, Go, Rust, TypeScript, PHP, and Swift.
- **Explanation**: Understand the transformation process with an explanation of key differences between source and target code.
- **Feedback**: Provide feedback to improve the platform.

## Installation
