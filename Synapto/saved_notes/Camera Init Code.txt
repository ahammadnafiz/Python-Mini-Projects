Camera Init Code

The image shows a Python code snippet, likely part of a larger program. It appears to be the `__init__` method of a class, which initializes a video stream. The code attempts to open a camera at a specified index, and if unsuccessful, it tries the next index. It also sets the frame width, height, and frame rate for the video stream.
