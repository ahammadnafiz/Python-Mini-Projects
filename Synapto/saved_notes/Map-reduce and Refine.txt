Map-Reduce and Refine

The image shows two different approaches to processing large amounts of data using LLMs. The Map-Reduce approach involves breaking down the data into chunks, processing each chunk with an LLM, and then combining the results to produce a final answer. The Refine approach involves processing the data with multiple LLMs, each of which produces a refined version of the answer, with the final answer being the most refined version.
