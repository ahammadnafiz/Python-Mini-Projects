Map-reduce and Refine

This diagram illustrates two methods for processing information using LLMs. The first method, Map-reduce, involves breaking down a large document into chunks, processing each chunk with an LLM, and then combining the results to generate a final answer. The second method, Refine, is similar but uses multiple LLMs to refine the answer.
