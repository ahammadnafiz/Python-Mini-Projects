Python Code

This Python code defines a function called "file_upload" that handles file uploads. It checks if a modified DataFrame already exists and, if not, uses the Streamlit file uploader to allow the user to upload a CSV file. If a file is uploaded, the function reads the CSV file with encoding and saves the modified DataFrame. If a modified DataFrame already exists, it displays a warning message to clear the existing DataFrame before uploading a new one.
