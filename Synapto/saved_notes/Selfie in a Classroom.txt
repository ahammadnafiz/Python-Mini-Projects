Selfie in a Classroom

The photo is a selfie of a young man with short dark hair and a beard, holding a green ruler. He is wearing a light-colored button-down shirt with a checkered pattern. The photo is likely taken in a classroom, as there are computers in the background, along with a white board, and a ceiling fan.
