Router Chain for LLM

The diagram illustrates a router chain for an LLM. The input is first processed by the LLM. The output of the LLM is then routed to a specific chain based on the input. If the input is related to a specific subject, such as Math, History, etc., the input is routed to the corresponding subject chain. Otherwise, the input is routed to the default chain. Each chain consists of a sequence of steps, represented by the red links.
